# Fake-Yelp-Reviews-Detection

<b> The classification of "fake" Yelp reviews using Multinomial Naive Bayes Theorem and sentiment analysis model </b>

The team chose to explore the Yelp dataset reviews, motivated by the common issues users face with many deceptions found on the site. Through some research, we found that deceptive language consists of distinct signs. These signs consist of various things like types of words used, user verfication, timestamp and percentage of verbs. By using the Yelp datase\, we believe we could improve on the impact a sentiment analysis model could have to extract fake reviews if it was combined additionally with functions that would vet out reviews for different signs. The model and functions will help us create a classification system for extreme positive and negative reviews. Our goal is to help users detect all positive and negative reviews that do not portray how the user truly felt about the business.
