I mean, you really can't go wrong with a place that serves poutine 24\/7. The staff are definitely friendly (once they acknowledge you - see my last comment below) - maybe more so once they realized I didn't speak francais and thus was clearly a tourist. This was my second time to Montreal and I'm glad I did a little more research on Poutine (thanks, yelp!). My first time, albeit good, was certainly not the best considering I probably ate at a tourist trap.\n\nI had a small \"La Jaco\" and it was enough to send me into food coma by the time I got back to my hotel. \n\nLa Jaco = Ground Beef, Onions, Mushrooms, Cheese Curds (of course), French Fries (well, obviously!) all drenched in a black pepper sauce.

Considering that it was a rather busy Saturday night, we were seated almost immediately. I believe they accept cash only. There is a small ATM on-site, located near the door.\n\nMy friend ordered the \"Three Amigos\", which is a poutine topped with three types of sausages. I chose a Club Sandwich made with turkey meat and opted to upgrade my side of fries to a standard poutine. Although there seems to be a variety of local and microbrewery beers available on the menu, we ordered soft drinks with our meals.\n\nBetween the background music and the chatty crowd, the atmosphere was a bit loud for our tastes, making it a bit difficult to have a conversation across the table. Some of the decor is a bit kitschy, as we were seated under a pillar with a large artificial branches with a few oranges hanging down. Our waitress looked like a throwback to the 80's -- complete with big hair, bright scarlet red lipstick, overdone makeup, skintight black leggings, short booties and a huge bejewelled Madonna-style cross necklace! Luckily, she seemed to be the only one of the sort; the rest of the wait staff were dressed very casual and normal in style.\n\nOur meals arrived relatively quickly; although I had to ask for mayonnaise (which is unusual in Montreal, most places almost always bring some with Club Sandwich orders). I also had to ask for a knife for my mayo, as we were only served with napkins and forks.\n\nI am rather picky about my poutine and I was rather disappointed by the \"standard\" one served by La Banquise, as it wasn't exactly to my preferred tastes.\n\nThere are several sides to poutine lovers -- some absolutely demand the grease-drenched soggy fries, others prefer slightly floppy fries with theirs, and I am one of those that prefer my fries to be somewhat crisper and still have some shape to them.\n\nThe poutine had somewhat floppy fries and were a bit more greasy than I prefer. The sauce was a touch heavy and almost chunky in texture. At least the cheese curds were fresh, if not overly generous in quantity.\n\nMy dinner companion was fairly satisfied by his poutine, however he mentioned that what \"made it\" was the variety of sausages that topped it -- otherwise it was a rather standard fare poutine for Montreal.\n\nFor most people, the \"regular\" portion is more than enough; only order the large is you are *really* hungry or are sharing between two people.\n\nOverall, we were slightly disappointed by La Banquise; mostly because we had heard such marvelous things about this place. If you have never experienced poutine, or have not had much variety in types of poutine, I could see how this place would seem heavenly.\n\nHowever, as a long-time Montrealer, it was actually only a little above average -- the only major saving grace was the variety of styles of poutine offered on the menu. The prices were a little on the high side, especially for the more standard poutine styles -- you can get better for less money elsewhere in the city.\n\nWe're not sure if we would bother returning, as neither of us were particularly impressed by our dining experience.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Everything was really good (including the corn dog)! \n\nThe only two things I could point out that made it not a 100% 5-star review was that the fries seemed like they were just freezer fries, which with that kind of volume I can understand, they probably go through 75 lbs. of fries a day.

Not very crowded on a Thursday afternoon as I found. Great atmosphere.\n\nI enjoyed a Cidre Mystique while I eagerly awaited my poutine. I ordered La Taquise. A Mexican poutine? What?\n\nOn a small plate that held so much more than what you'd think, comes my poutine. Covered in dollops of guacamole, sour cream, and diced tomatoes, it's a \"Frenchcanexican\" treat. Dipping the oil-brown 'frites' in the sour cream proved to be my favourite bit. The Cidre Mystique paired surprisingly well with it, followed by a quick swig of water.\n\nI'm a mechanical, gastro-adventurer, so I eat in a certain process in order to satisfy my taste buds the most. So as follows: poutine, cider, water, repeat! Your dish will warm you, your cider will excite you, and your water will cleanse you for another go.\n\nThey've got a great selection of music here, too. At one point, you hear Johnny Cash, then Daft Punk, then hardcore rap? I don't know how they made it all work, but they really did!\n\nNot even half of my regular sized portion is gone and I'm already full, so I don't suggest getting a large unless you're sharing with a friend. They've got two large columns of different poutine that you can choose from. Additional sauces are available if they don't originally come with your choice of poutine.\n\nIf you're foreign and eating here, don't make the same mistake I did; La Banquise does not accept credit, nor foreign debit. If you have Canadian debit, you're fine. I ended up having to come up with the idea of giving the waitress my driver's license as a sort of promise that I'd be back in a jiff after going to an ATM to withdrawl Canadian dollars (they accept USD, but I preferred CAD). Banque Laurentienne has ATMs that will accept any card, withdraw CAD, and they only charge 2$ as with any ATM. The waitress was very understanding and didn't make me feel like a bumbling fool.\n\nLa Banquise is a very nice place to go if you're wanting to take a little time to yourself in the afternoon and indulge in wonderful, cheese-curd-covered goodness.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Stopped by with family, recieved good service and relatively no wait to get in (it was a Sunday afternoon, so that helped). \n\nThe menu is glorious. A variety of toppings will overwhelm you upon first viewing. When you get your order, you will experience that tenfold. They really stack their toppings up. I generally like only a bit of topping, like NY Fries does, but La Banquise smothers their crisp fries with a heaping serving of topping. If you're a fan of decadent poutine, this will be right up your alley. If you're more into a surplus of fries, the rest of the menu besides La Classique might be too rich. \n\nSome family members and I ended up ordering our meals to go. We spent the later evening polishing off the mouth-watering remnants. Yes, even their cold fries were good (albeit still too rich)!\n\nSince the trip, my sister has been craving their poutine.

We had both never tried poutine before. When we arrived there was a line that went outside by about 5 people. We waited maybe 20 mins for a table, so not bad. Warning: this place is cramped when busy! If you're claustrophobic or can't stand sitting next to others while you dine, I would recommend getting your poutine to go!\nAfter reviewing the menu of over 30 poutines, I settled on Le Matty: onions, peppers, mushrooms, and bacon. My husband got La Savoyarde: bacon, onions, swiss, and sour cream. Our food arrived quickly and was piping hot and fresh. The regular size portion is HUGE, we definitely could have split one. This being my first poutine experience, I thought it was pretty tasty! The fries were hand-cut style and cooked to a dark golden brown. The cheese curds were melted slightly, and the bacon and veggies were grilled. The addition of the sour cream on my husband's went really well with the fries, gravy and cheese! My only complaint: I was a bit under impressed with the gravy as it did not taste homemade. I was glad I got mine with the veggies and bacon because they added some of the flavor that the gravy was missing. I would like to try poutine again with a creamier homemade gravy. Overall, it was a good experience, but don't expect gourmet flavors here! It is what it says: gravy, cheese, fries, and toppings, nothing more or less! Would be perfect for a hangover!\nThe service was good.

Maybe \"slop\". \n\nAnyway, les gens du coin all said this was the spot to pop your poutine cherry, with its extremely long list of poutine plats and 24-hour 'round the clock service. So we plunked down around midnight and ordered a monstrosity... I believe it was called the T-Rex? A heaping plate of cheese curds & fries, doused in a deluge of gravy and in this case, topped with a couple animals' worth of meaty bits. To be honest, the meaty bits were pretty gross. I LOVED the cheese curds, and the fries with gravy were...well, fries with gravy. Tasty, but you never feel good about eating such nonsense. In retrospect, I would've been -much- happier with the \"Classique\", sans meat. \n\nI'm going to give this place 4 stars because I imagine if you LIKE poutine, or you're a first-timer like I was, you can't get better dished up 'round the clock in Montreal than at La Banquise, nor can you get more varieties. However, it misses a 5 star review because it has just about the nastiest bathroom I have ever encountered, anywhere. Truly, it was awful. Two were out of order, and the one available had no paper, suspicious pools of liquid all over the floor, stench...needless to say I fled. \nOh, and after 22H you have to pay your waitress up front, in cash.

The \"La Bacon\" was rich and hearty with a generous portion of bacon. The \"Poivree\" was also excellent. We stuck with the traditional cheese curds on both. The amount of sauce on each was inconsistent (much less on the pepper than the bacon), but that was OK and gave us a chance to decide how much sauce we liked. The fries were crispy and well done.\n\nThe IPA and the Hefeweizen were fairly bland, but were nice with the poutine.\n\nSince this was my first poutine experience, I don't really have a great frame of reference; Resto didn't overwhelm me with flavor, but it was a lively atmosphere, great service, and tasty food.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

On my recent trip to Montreal, I made this my first spot to visit.  What a disappointment it was!\n\nService here is terrible, and it absolutely ruined our experience. My boyfriend I had just finished driving from Boston to Montreal and were starving. We didn't have time to exchange our money to Canadian, but we figured the place would take credit cards since it's such a tourist favorite. \n\nThe minute we ordered the waitress came back with the bill. We didn't make much of it, but she kept coming back and pestering us about the bill. So we decided to pay, but we hadn't even received our food yet. I gave her my credit card, but she wouldn't take it because she said the restaurant does not take American credit cards. We explained to her that we had a Visa and everyone takes Visas. She then changed her story and said that the machine that takes credit cards was down so that's why they couldn't take cards. It was cash only, but we told her we didn't have any only american, which she eagerly said she would take. I didn't to do that, but we were starving so we gave her the money. I understand since it's busy and she wanted to get paid that she didn't have time to convert the correct change. But we definitely did not receive the correct change, and she took much more than was on the bill. We figured we didn't need to leave a tip because she had already taken most of it and more.\n\nWhen we finally received our food, I was so disappointed, not at all what I remembered. The food was terrible. I had the T-Rex and it was just lukewarm. We left a little defeated, and then the waitress ran after us telling us that tip is not included. We tried to explain to her that she took more money when she gave us the change in Canadian, but she didn't understand or wanted to take more of our money. When my boyfriend asked if we could speak to a manager she quickly declined and let us go. Overall the entire interaction with her was incredibly sketchy and I do believe we were taken advantage of because we were tourists. Later during our trip we talked to a lot of locals who said that this is not the place to go for poutine, I would try other places if I were you.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I ordered a steamed hot dog as well but the bread was dry and old.\nThe poutine was delicious tho. \nMy husband got La Danse, which was chicken, onions, and pepper sauce, he ate all of it because it was delicious.\n\nWhen you order after 9pm they make you pay in advance after you've ordered the food.\n In total 26$, a bit expensive for two small poutines and a steamie.

Poutine is typical winter food for me; when it's -30 Celsius outside, all my body wants is fat in a warm and edible form.  The poutine at La Banquise certainly met all of the requirements.\n\nWhen we got there, it was extremely busy but the waitress managed to find us a small table within a few minutes.  The décor was brightly funky, bright, and cheery; the music also feel into that category.  There's nothing calm about La Banquise, but it has a fun warm atmosphere that is appealing at 11pm in February.   The waitress quickly brought us menus and we settled in to peruse the options.  The menu hosts about 24 different varieties of poutine, along with burgers, hot dogs, and other fast food fare.  I would suggest going with the poutine though; that's what they're known for and is probably why your there.\n\nI ordered a plain poutine, while my friend ordered the T-Rex.  The plain poutine consists of French fries, cheese curds, and gravy, while the T-Rex adds sausage, bacon, and ground beef on top of that.  The price might seem a little high for French fries, but I found the servings to be more than generous.   The first thing I noticed was that the French fries were made there; you can see the tubs of peeled and cut potatoes beside the deep fryer.  The cheese curds were a perfect combination of chewy, rubbery, and soft.  The gravy was a little too salty, but the endless glasses of water that our waitress poured us made it tolerable.  \n\nOverall, I greatly enjoyed eating a La Banquise.  I think that this restaurant is very unique to Quebec.  It's a great place to hit up after a long run, a night of dancing, or as a chaser to an evening of beers.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

We are lovers of food and really wanted to go somewhere that had a distinct food culture. We found a food mecca in Montreal. One of the items on our list of must-eats was poutine, a native dish to Quebec. To us, it just sounded like something we needed to get our hands on!\n\nWe tried poutine for the first time at this little diner for a late dinner. We were less than impressed. After doing our due diligence and scouring the web, we came across La Banquise. So on a gorgeous day, we took the metro out to a quaint little neighborhood and walked a few blocks to La Banquise. This was definitely your typical dive, metal tables, benches and random art work and mismatched pieces as décor. The place was packed on a late afternoon, but we were seated relatively quickly. I can see how this place is such a draw, especially for a late night crowd, and with the bonus of it being open 24 hours.\n\nWe ordered a large poutine to share, and had it topped with hot dog, bacon and mushrooms. Yes, you can add additional toppings to your poutine. What came out was a gigantic plate filled to the brim and loaded with fries, gravy, hot dog slices, bacon, mushrooms and cheese curds! It may not look like the most appetizing plate, but it was divine! The cheese curds were melting and provided an even more decadent touch to the dish. The fries soaked up the gravy and the bacon and hot dogs gave each bite the needed amount of sodium; it was very savory. It was real treat, and worth my cholesterol shooting up a few points!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

It was raining cats and dogs on Saturday, but my hubs and I biked here anyways and arrive pretty soaked at about 11am. The place was full but we got seated pretty quickly.\n\nThere were other diner type foods on the menu like sandwiches, but we really only came for the poutine, and judging by what the other tables have ordered, others came for the same thing. We got La Danse and L'Obelix, which was a chicken with bacon and onions poutine and a smoked meat poutine respectively. The  regular size was quite large and definitely more than enough for one. The La Danse poutine came with a lighter gravy than the L'Obelix poutine, we preferred the darker gravy. The poutines came with lots of topping and cheese curds, and was dripping with gravy. The fries had a home fries taste and texture to them. Overall, we like it but wished that the cheese curds were more melted and that the whole dish came out hotter, it was warmish hot and not pipping hot.\n\nWhen we left around noonish, there was a line to the door for seats, so I guess we got lucky and avoided the huge rush. Overall, I would return to try other poutine dishes here, there were lots of options and you can customize your poutine with whatever topping you want. I probably would not wait in a huge long line in the rain as some other folks were doing for the poutine though.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Kitchens were already closed in most places so it seemed to be one of very few places to eat (it's open 24 hours, how convenient--AND dangerous). \n\nIt's your typical MTL greasy-spoon specializing in poutine, which is something the city does very well. There are about a million poutines to choose from, along with staples like burgers, all-day breakfast, etc. I didn't want to overdo the grease factor as it was quite late and I had my food itinerary set for the next day (what can I say? I'm nerdy like that) for which I wanted to ensure I had room in my stomach, but we ended up each getting a burger (~$5) and the two of us shared a large poutine (~$10). The burgers were standard diner fare--no going wrong there--with the usual toppings and condiments available. \n\nFor the poutine, I chose the Savoyarde which is a new item that does not appear on their regular menu, and anyway, the original poutine can be had anywhere so I thought we ought to try something new. The very thought of the Savoyarde brought back memories of a recent trip which included stops in France, so it was a must for me. It turned out to be an original poutine topped with their version of Savoyarde toppings which include things like bacon (instead of lardons), sour cream (instead of the cheese and cream combo), and some mushrooms (not a lot). It was good enough, and definitely hit the spot on that cold night.\n\nThe food (at least from among what we had) would normally elicit about 4* tops but the service and atmosphere (young and hip; definitely a post-bar kinda place) take it one star further. This place, with its menu and clientele, really capture the Montreal vibe. La Banquise is in a French part of town but the friendly servers were able to communicate in English just as well (useful for the many tourists I noticed), and they did so very happily, unlike in some establishments. *ahem* Food is cheap, servings massive, and our order arrived pretty quickly considering the place was PACKED.

The restaurant my friends wanted to go to had an unacceptable line-up outside. This was the closet place nearby.

What had I been missing for the past 6 years?!\n\nThe reason for the 4 stars: while this was a poutine place, I was feeling slightly groggy and decided to order a latte. The lady didn't bother grinding beans on the spot, she instead flicked in whatever was left in the grinder from who knows how many hours past. She grabbed a thermos of milk already in the fridge  and completely nuked it with the steamer, creating huge bubbles and no micro-foam.

I learned the hard way, when they didn't take my Chase Freedom credit card.\n\nFood: I think sizing is important to mention. Between 4 people, we ordered 2 large poutines and it was more than enough. We ordered the B.O.M. as well as the Fred Caillou. Both are good.....if you like merguez sausage. I'm not poutine connoisseur by any means but I would recommend this place. \n\nKeep in mind that the combination of merguez sausage, bacon, and gravy in the B.O.M. caused the dish to be quite salty. \n\nFred Caillou was also very salty, due to the combination of smoked meats, merguez sausage, and gravy....kind of like a beefed up version of the B.O.M. \n\nSo if you're looking at ordering the B.O.M. or the Fred Caillou, I'd suggest ordering only one or the other due to the fact that they're so similar. \n\nTry the Bec Cola...it was unique. Very sweet. Maple Syrup soda is a good way to wash down all the poutine! \n\nService: Fast and quick. Try to avoid the weekends.....when the line can wrap around the building. \n\nWould I come back?

Maybe it's also known for its French culture, but that's besides the point. We are talking about food here! People used to tell me, \"Look, you don't know what poutine tastes like until you try it in Montreal.\" My retort was, \"Where's Montreal, and what the schnitzel is poutine?\" I admit, this was many many moons ago. Since then, I have not only eaten poutine many times (I did go to university after all), but I've also had it in one of Montreal's most famous poutine eateries - La Banquise. \n\nOn to the bigger question. Does this place live up to its applause? Well, it does and it doesn't. Let's be honest here, ANYTHING tastes good at 2am when you've just had ten drinks. But, in all honesty, the poutine here is a good time. The line out the door, however, is another story. \n\nThe menu is loooong and all the types of poutine have names like T-Rex, Elvis, and Frank. I usually get the classic poutine (boring, I know) and leave the bacon, green peppers and beef to other meals that I eat. La Banquise also offers up breakfast, but I'm not sure if anyone ever orders it unless it's to ask for eggs benny on a poutine.\n\nSo, will I return to this famous Montreal house of poutine?

Let's go over the basics of Poutine.  It's fries served with a brown gravy and topped with cheese curds.  Yeah, it doesn't make you friends amongst Cardiologists, I have heard Quebecois refer to it jokingly as \"Montcalm's revenge\", but hey, sex is both funny and kinda disgusting, but who doesn't love getting it on, right?  Right. Poutine is the culinary equivalent of dirty itchy smelly sex that leaves you sweaty all over...so bad and oh so good.  Anyways, In order for poutine to be dirty sex satisfying, a competent establishment should meet several criteria for quality in such a simple (but by no means easy) product:  \n\na) The fries must be crisp on the outside, savory and soft with some moistness on the inside, and not too thin so it'll hold up to an onslaught of gravy.  It should also be salted so it tastes good by itself\n\nb) The gravy should be hot, flavorful and thick, so it'll provide a lipsmacking base of umami.  A good gravy reminds you of a good consomme...you can sip it by itself.\n\nc) The cheese curds should be room temperature, or at least it should not be cold.  It should squeak with milky freshness when you bite it.  It should be an ideal vehicle for absorbing and retaining the gravy flavors, and the population numerous enough to act as a meat-like counterpoint to the soft, crisp but bland potatoes.\n\nd) All 3 ingredients should form a sublime union, the resultant product a greater sum of its parts.  It should be both crisp and soft, potatoey-and-gravy-meaty, refreshingly cheesy - Quebec cheese curds, Nova Scotia\/Ontario potatoes, and their confederation in a good, salty and flavorful, very warm gravy, enough to warm you up on a cool day.\n\nAnd Resto La Banquise...failed on all counts.  Let's start with the potatoes - thinnish potatoes that are inexplicably sweet (did they put sugar in there?  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING), which does not crisp up at all.   There's the gravy - a bit too thin, not much flavor, does not taste good by itself, and in the case of my serving of La Classique?  It was barely lukewarm.  The cheese?  Cool\/cold - feels like they just took it out of the fridge.  It's supposed to be returned to room temperature prior to serving so it'll not cool down the gravy\/fries when you put it in.  On top of that, it's not an entirely generous portion of it to mingle well with the fries and gravy to make it work.  I wonder if the line cooks preparing poutine hates its very existence and want it to bury it alive.  How else would you explain adding all those crazy toppings onto it to make it appealing to the obvious out-of-towners?\n\nI am disappointed by this supposed landmark, a pretender to the pantheon of culinary achievement, one that does not hold up to scrutiny.  The ingredients of greatness are probably there (the steamie hot dogs from Lesters were delicious, the seating is comfortable and the service is passably good), but their poutine needs work.\n\nDo not make limp fries, add sugar, dump pieces of cheese curds straight from the fridge, pour weak gravy on it and serve it lukewarm.  That's like asking the guys at Wilensky's to cut the sandwich, for the counterman at Schwartzs to cut the viande fumee thin and lean, or for the staff at Le Centre Bell to hoist a Bruins flag.  You don't go to St. Viateurs and ask them to make a salty doughy New York style bagel. You don't do stuff like that in Montreal and expect to get away with it.\n\nI suppose you want a good alternative for Poutine - okay, here's my suggestion: Patati Patata on Rue Rachel and Rue St. Laurent - there's a reason why they are constantly busy.  They have higher turnover, they also show their Poutine respect by making the fries crisper, the gravy thicker\/more flavorful, and their cheese curds are not as cold.  The amount of curds were well balanced and the results blend better into the mix.  This is not to say that their poutine is the best, but they are definitely better.  \n\nRotisserie Romado on Rue Rachel and Rue Buillion will do a good version as well, with lots of crispy salty fries, lots of fresh curds, and their gravy is actually spicy.  Damn the lines and order some with your chicken, and get some Sumol or Guarana.  \n\nAs for this place?  I don't know.  I guess you should try it just to see how bad Poutine could be, just so you can hanker for much better ones somewhere else.","useful":4,"funny":5,"cool":2}

I mean, I would have no issue with the price point if it was as spectacular as people say it would be. I ordered the \"pepper sauce\" with spicy sausage and banana peppers.i know right?....sounds delicious on paper for sure but the recommended pepper sauce had peppercorns that were not properly crushed, the cheese curds were massive clumps sitting right in the center away from the sauce, so it didnt even melt properly, and the amount of banana peppers exceeded the amount of fries. I mean I'm sure the recipie isn't hot peppers, cheese curds, gravy and a sprinkle of potatoes now is it? To be honest, I've never written a bad review because I can literally enjoy anything, especially being east indian, my stomach can handle the spice.  However the drive back to Toronto was filled with acidity and indigestion.  More over, when I asked to take it out in a box, I was handed my package, then asked for it back because the guy in the kitchen \"forgot\" to do something. After handing it back to him, he drops the box, takes it back in the kitchen, does what he needs to and hands it back over to me. After getting in my car and driving off, I start feeling the paper bag leak on my lap! So basically the guy didnt even have the decency to give me a new box after dropping it. I know I should have double checked but hey I thought it is common sense to do that for a customer especially when you slam the box on the floor in front of them! Guess I have high r expectations..... oh and I forgot to mention, the guy went to add extra hot peppers!\n\n The only couple good thing I can say about it were the actual fries, but if you go wrong deep frying potatoes,  then there is a problem.

Some even try to franchise themselves, opening a slew of restaurants under the same name to try to make themselves more recognizable, but again, they are only second rate to the original poutine master.\n\nI have to admit that in the dozens of times I have gone to this fabulous restaurant, I have never tried the regular poutine (fries, gravy, cheese). I have always tried a different type of gastronomic perfection, my favourite being the Taquise: a regular poutine combination plus guacamole, diced tomatoes and sour cream. As most who read this will likely imagine, it can be difficult to accept. But the moment you see it presented, in its glorious stacked ingredients beauty, you know you're in for a treat. And the taste is unbeatable. I suggest adding a little Tabasco sauce if you want that extra edge.\n\nThe price is extremely reasonable . The only thing that could be improved is the service, but this is to be expected for a place as popular as this.

I got a combo meal that involved a burger and a classic poutine. I would highly highly recommend not getting anything else but the poutine.

The service wasn't remarkable nor was it slow. We were seated quickly and swiftly by a friendly waitress that seemed to know only very rudimentary English. She's hardly to blame since it's located on Le Plateau and half of the residents there look at me like a booger is hanging out of my nose whenever I start a conversation in English.\n\nThe meat happened to be better than the actual poutine. The fries were above average but there were more stretchers in the restaurant than there were bits of cheese in my poutine. In my honest opinion, the gravy was inferior to many places I've been to. It wasn't anything close to the thick petroleum tar you get at Decarie Hotdog but it was cheap, thick and tasteless.\n\nThe meat was in substantial quantity and it felt like they neglected the rest of the poutine because of it. The hot dogs are cheap and most likely came from Super C's 8 for 2$ packages that sit on shelves for months before a poor sod tests his luck at not getting an indigestion.\n\nThe selection of poutine is huge though. You'll find one for you.\n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance is nice. Everyone was happy, the restaurant is cozy and surprisingly well aerated for such a small place.

We were seated in the outside patio area (which is cute and saves you from the stuffiness of the interior seating). The waitress was friendly enough. I let her know that I don't eat beef but liked some of the flavour combos with beef and so was going to substitute the beef for merguez sausage which I told was lamb. So I ordered the La Reggae substituting the beef for merguez sausage and after a 30 minute wait I got my poutine, with merguez sausage and beef!! So when I bought up the issue to her, she looked confused and asked me  what I wanted with the biggest dose of attitude. She kept insisting that I had asked for both beef and marguez sausage which was astonishing. Then she disappeared.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes another waitress came over, after I flagged her down. I explained the situation that I don't eat beef and that I wanted the La Reggae with the sausage instead. She then informs me that the sausage is also beef. OK! Well then I asked for the La Reggae with bacon. Keep in mind that this was now altogether more than 1 hour since we had come in and my friend was almost done her poutine. Not an word of apology. No sense of urgency. Nothing.\n\nI chalked it up to a miscommunication. But my bff who speaks French said that it was pretty clear that I said I didn't eat beef, so there was no way the 1st waitress should have mistaken that for an addition and not substitution.\n\nTwenty minutes later, I got my La Reggae with bacon and when I say bacon, you literally could not see the bacon, even after I moved around the fries and the mountain of guacamole. So after trying to flag down the waitress for another 10 minutes, I asked her where the bacon was. She proceeds to point at a shard of bacon in the guac and says that \"There is the bacon, when you substitute you get 3 pieces of bacon.\" This was opposed to the heaping mountain of bacon you get if you just order the cheaper La Bacon which people around me had. Don't you think that would have been pertinent information to maybe tell a customer!?!? The attitude was just flowing out of this waitress like you could not imagine. I tried explaining the situation again and pointed out that I'd been here 1.5 hours trying to get my order right and was told \"what you want me to do\". To say that I controlled my anger in that situation and left ASAP after paying $13 for mushy fries under a mountain of tasteless guac, would be an understatement.\n\nNow my friend who had her order arrive properly, was also very underwhelmed. She used to worked in McDonalds back in her youth and told me that the dark color of the fries are due to reusing old oil which is very unhealthy. She found the poutine to be average at best.\n\nI feel like that this place is a tourist trap, counting of their high reviews as a way of lowering service standards.\n\nI had much better poutine at the A&W afterwards.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

However, we both agree the poutine was meh. Their fries were unflavourful, gravy was unmemorable and the cheese curds\/fries ratio was pretty off. In my opinion this place is way overrated.

I could. not. wait.\n\nWe finally get here. My husband, me, and our two kids, one of whom is about 2 years old. We waited about 20 minutes on line. (Got there a bit before 6 pm.) I got to peruse the amazing poutine menu and fantasize about all of the different ways I could enjoy my first poutine. Should I go classic? Mexican? Italian? Veggie? Meat-fest? And then came the magic moment when we were told that there was a table for us. Yes, yes, yes. Here we go.  \n\nThe 2-year-old basically became possessed as soon as we sat down at the table. Menus were placed in front of us. The 2-year-old swatted them right to the floor. The nice waitress brought over a kids menu with games and a jar of crayons. The 2-year-old alternatively threw the crayons on the floor, put some in his mouth, and then knocked over his water. And screamed and cried. Other restaurant patrons looked over to assess who exactly was destroying their dining experience. The waitress came over and apologized in advance for what would be a long wait for food as there were some complications in the kitchen that night. If ever I wished that a spaceship would materialize and suck me up into the night sky...\n\nWe order. Four small poutines among us of different varieties. I choose a classic and a veggie version to share with the 2-year-old, figuring that one of those will satisfy his discriminating tastes. We wait for the poutine. The 2-year-old has become a heartless monster, hell-bent on destroying the atmosphere of the entire restaurant. So many things are flying off the table at this point, I can't even keep track. We resort to trying to distract him by giving him salt and pepper to taste. He likes it. What the...\n\nThe poutine comes. Oh   my    gahhhhhhhhh, it looks so good. I take a bite. It tastes soooo good. I just want to dig in and stay in that moment forever. I am there. And then I am not, because the 2-year-old starts throwing poutine on the floor. So the rest of us basically cram poutine into our face holes as quickly as we can, ask for to-go boxes for the rest, and beat it out of there, not daring to look at any of the other patrons.\n\nSigh.\n\nThe next day my husband took the kids for the day.

Well, I was wrong.  There was already a short line inside the door, and the place was heaving- with children.  Seems that parents of  pre-schoolers *do* eat this early, and they bring their spawn in great number.  Managed to be seated immediately, though, by dint of only needing a table for one.  Got the second last seat in the house, as it turned out, in a dark corner.  Water glass (already filled) and menu hit the table as I was seated, a nice touch.\n\nDespite my being in a wretchedly difficult place to reach, the waitress was quick to worm her way to me and take my order.  Asked for a regular-sized classic poutine, a Banquise burger with Dijon instead of the usual orange sauce, and a St-Ambroise.  Did not have to wait long for it all to arrive;  just long enough to notice the extremely repetitive dance-techno music being played just a little too loud over the already considerable din in the room.  It was pounding out a deeply tribal message, and that message was \"please chew quickly and get out, so we can sell some more of this stuff\".  Just a little too obvious a musical psy-op, for what's basically a hip diner.  Dinged them a star while I waited for my oats.\n\nThe food and beer all arrived at once, exactly as ordered.  Poutine portion was definitely generous;  my plate was heaped, and almost overflowing.   Burger was a proper size for the price, and well-garnished.  Both tasted fine, while neither being spectacular.  Both, unfortunately, were only warm, and not hot.  Given how quickly they arrived, this was disappointing.  Fries fresh from the fryer and sauce kept on a proper simmer, especially, should have been screaming hot, at least at the very core of the mound.  But the wait at the kitchen push-through and the trip to my table somehow managed to suck the bulk of the heat out of my supper.  My cheese curds were barely melted.  Another star lost, right there.\n\nRestrooms (I tried two) both had trash on the floor, and both had the slipperiest, soapiest floors I've ever put boots on.  The cracks in one bowl's rim must be from someone's teeth.\n\nWith all that said, this place isn't without definite merit.  Both the placière and my waitress were alert, memorably courteous and pleasant in the middle of an obvious rush, and good at their jobs.  And the food is taken seriously, ingredient-wise. It tasted fine, after all.   The people-watching was excellent, too, at least while I was there;  it seemed like I was surrounded by groups of good-looking twenty- and thirty-something brunettes, all animatedly catching up on old times and planning new adventures while gleefully pounding pure cholesterol into their smiling faces. The table of sleekly black-haired girls next to me was speaking entirely in an oddly-tinted Spanish.  My idle moments between mouthfuls weren't exactly devoid of wallpaper.\n\nBut the not-hot burger and poutine, the roomful of rather loud children, and the 1980s behavioral science music selection... Yes, I'd eat here again, but not without a deliberate motive.  \n\nOh... When I left, the line was out the door.  Be forewarned.\n\nAnyhow.  Banquise:  Been there, done that.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":2}

I use to think it was the best vegetarian poutine in Montreal but, after trying many others, it's hard to keep thinking that.\n\nYea, it's pretty darn good but there's something about their sauce that will make you feel sick after eating it. I don't know what it is, maybe it's MSG in the sauce, the overly sweet taste or just the fat levels being so high. For a lack of better words, It really doesn't taste \"clean\". It's a bit like eating Cheetos: it tastes great but you know it's really bad for you and that you'll regret it later. And just like those neon orange munchies-satisfiers you just won't be able to stop shoveling Banquise's poutine down your throat because it really is addicting... like crack.\n\nWhile I'd never associate poutine with \"health food\" - who am I kidding, it is what it is right - there are plenty of options in Montreal for poutine that are much healthier and won't make you suspicious of what ingredients are in the sauce.\n\nAnyway......I better stop writing there because the more I write about Banquise's poutine, the more I crave for it. Ugh. I can hear voices in my head, one is clearly drooling while pushing me to go back for more pleasure - and regret - and the other is screaming: \"No! Don't do it! You know it's baaaaaad for you!\"\n\nAnd clearly, because I rated Banquise 3 stars and not 2, the former has registered a win... yet again.\n\nTo enjoy, in very small doses.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":4}

I like 'em crispy or soft, criss-cut or curly.  \nBut fries as a meal?  I'm listening...\n\nDuring my seven day stay in Montreal, I had poutine three times.  Because we showed up on a busy Friday night, we decided to go to Poutineville for one of those times.  Expect to see a line out the door, but you may get lucky.  On a Thursday night after we got out of the Kings\/Habs game, we were able to get sat right away.  \n\nI liked La Banquise a little more than I liked Poutineville.  La Banquise's fries are smaller.  Their vegan gravy was thicker and did not make the fries soggy like the ones I had at Poutineville.  The curds were a lot squeakier at Poutineville, however.  The cheese at La Banquise didn't have that squeak factor, but it may have been because they were slightly more melted.  They actually reminded me more of mozzarella than curds.  The portions were comparable.  The plate seems smaller at La Banquise, but they give you a generous mounded serving.  Regular is plenty for one person.  La Banquise has some creative signature dishes and I only had the classic version at Poutineville.  Poutineville has several different gravies and all of them are vegetarian, except for the meat sauce.\n\nThey serve Bec sodas, a local company that uses all natural ingredients and sweetens their drinks with maple syrup.  I tried the cola and cranberry sodas.  They were extremely carbonated and the sodas would bubble up through the straw.  It added to the whimsy of drinking soda from a glass bottle.  I'm not a big soda drinker, but I am a sucker for anything maple.  I enjoyed the Bec cola.  The cranberry had kind of an unpleasant aftertaste.\n\nService was on point.

In the last 5 years or so Houston's has really put our friendship to the test. Obviously through the years the prices have increased but in the last few they have really been increasing. Recently they halved the size over the caesar salad and almost doubled the price to 8 dollars. I know to a lot of the customer base this may not be a problem, but it still doesn't make it ok. Another recent issue is the change in potato type for their fries, they're just not as crispy as they used to be. But worst of all is the Houston's\/Hillstone split. When Houston's moved from the Esplanade to a bigger space across the street they rebranded with the company's Hillstone name. At first it was all still the same (except they moved the sushi over from Scottsdale) but now corn on the caesar salad? I guess I'll have to stick to Scottsdale.  I understand menu changes happen but it was so good and so the same for so many years why do they have to switch it all up now? Pretty sure the business model was working just fine.

I arrived there at 4:00 pm and met a business associate for a cocktail ($15 for a glass of cheap wine that other bars serve for $7).  At 5:00 pm the manager comes over and says that we either have to order a meal or leave.  It's all about money, and they need the small table for 2 that we are at.  We left and I will never return again.  We were talking quietly, not bothering anyone.  Our crime was sitting at a table for 2 when the dinner crowd began to arrive.  If that is your definition of a great restaurant, you can have this place.  I'll go elsewhere.  As I am the CEO of a mid-size business, this will hurt them more than they might think, but I've never had this happen before in my lifetime.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

They rave over the sundaes and the veggie burgers.  If it was just me, I'd give it 4 stars.\n\nOn our first visit, my wife got the veggie burger (which is made on site) and she said it was the best she's ever had.\n\nI am a burger and fries guy and I found the hickory burger to be flavorful and cooked properly.  They don't give you many fries but this seems to be the norm for upscale restaurants.\n\nWhat makes this place for me is the ambiance and the excellent, attentive, friendly wait staff.  ALL the waiters are very friendly, not just YOURS who is looking for a good tip.  You can tell the difference when friendliness is part of their training.\n\nWe did share a hot fudge sundae.  You should get a hot fudge sundae.  Here's the thing about those.  You get a generous helping of ice cream, whipped cream, and then your own pitcher of what I can only assume is their own chocolate sauce.  I have had better tasting sauces, but no one has ever let me decide how much sauce I want on it, so the pitcher on the side was pretty cool.  I happen to like a lot of sauce so I added more sauce every couple of bites.\n\nNote... we returned late the next night for another round of Sundaes.  We each got our own.  This is when I found out they had whipped cream.  My wife, apparently, ate the whipped cream on our first one without me noticing.","useful":3,"funny":4,"cool":1}

J Alexanders has the same food with the same hit and miss service so, why pay more at Houston's.  \n\nThe food we had this time was their spinach\/artichoke dip with chips and we each got their chicken salad which seemed to have more peanuty spice to it which we enjoyed.  Their brownie dessert is to die for....probably literally with all that sugar but oh so good.  The total for the food and 2 sodas and tip was $70 (no alcohol!).

Their coleslaw stands out more than your average coleslaw because it doesn't rely on a strong bitter taste that most coleslaws have because of the vinegar.  The glass of merlot I had with the meal was not too strong, not too weak, and had just the right amount of fruitiness to make it a perfect compliment to my steak dinner.

All in all, we have eaten more times at Houston's in the past 38 years than all the other comparably priced restaurants we have eaten at combined. The food, atmosphere and service are consistently that good.  \n\nNow that we are up in years, we don't typically eat as much food as we used to, and frequently will split a meal such as the ribs.  Not shown on the menu is that for $6.00 more, they'll add six more ounces of ribs above the standard rack, which is a perfect amount for the two of us along with the sides and wine.  If you like espresso, they make the best I've had anywhere.  It is essentially a double and very aromatic and rich--better then even my home-brewed version using my Illy machine.\n\nThe staff are always friendly, engaging if you invite it, and efficient.

In my life, I have never experienced such utter disdain for the wishes of the customer as I witnessed last night.  My overall experience in your restaurant was one star.  It would have been zero stars except for the collective, attentive service we were given by an obviously well trained wait staff.  It's too bad that you can't train away indifference towards the customer.  My problem is with a Houston's philosophy of: it doesn't matter what the customer wants, you are going to have it our way, or no way.\nHere is what happened.  The fish sandwich is fried.  One of us wanted it grilled.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  You have a grill.  One of us wanted the chicken salad with the dressing on the side.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  Is the salad pre-prepared with dressing on it?  One of us wanted that salad with salmon instead of chicken.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  This doesn't even deserve any further discussion.\nThe fact that we will never set foot in your restaurant again will have absolutely no impact on you at all.  It's obvious how little you care about our wishes.  What I hope has an impact, however, is that every single day I will relay my story of the lack of any customer service I received from you.  You see, I'm in the customer relationship business and my goal is to differentiate myself from you in every way.  I will tell this story to every client, prospective client, associate, and friend, as a lesson on how not to do business.  The positive is that the manner in which I treat my customers has been reinforced by your lack of basic business practices.  \nThat's good for me, bad for you.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0}

This is more than a restaurant, it's an experience. I am always happy when I'm at Houston's; partially because I like to pretend I'm rich like 80% of their diners when I'm there. Every once in a while I get a delicious martini with olives stuffed generously with goat cheese. Also their cheese burger is hands down the best burger anywhere.  ANYWHERE.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":2}

Typical Scottsdale eatery. Range Rovers, posers and people not at all concerned with paying WAY too much for average food. Hamburger, pork chop, kale salad and ribs. It was just ok. Have had better for much, much less money. First go around with the pork chop plate, the potatoes were cold. Got a replacement and they tried to charge for them. No pre-dinner anything. We asked for bread and they brought a \"bread service\" which is 4 slices of rosemary bread. $1 on the bill. Really? The ribs were pretty good but at $28 they should have been. Have had much better for a little more than half of that. The staff was attentive and very friendly, no problem there.

There was more  production of noise which was very distracting because the booths were awkwardly shaped (a quarter circle and the rest in chairs) for three people that you can hear your neighbor's conversation while waiting for your meal. The menu was downsized and it didn't have the quality selections that my family and I use to chose from so, for me, I settled for a mushroom burger. We were not pleased with the service either because they did a tag-team version so we were confused on who was \"helping\" us and it was taking a while to ask for a simple glass of water.

I used to love this place and went back last week after a couple of years and had a terrible experience! To be fair the food was very good however the service ruined everything.  Our seemingly high-school aged waitress seemed outmatched for the task at hand, after serving our appetizer she was AWOL was over 20 minutes while we waited and waited and waited just to order dinner.  There were no busboys filling waters, no managers walking the floor, in fact there didn't seem to be an employee in the building over 16 years old.  Finally we placed our order and once served, two of the four entrees had to be sent back; one for the wrong temp and a plate of ribs was completely cold.  Then that was it for 20 minutes, she took the two meals and was AWOL again.  Now two of us were completely finished eating and still no sign of the other entrees or waitress (or busboy or manager or anyone else).  We finally figured out who the manager was and flagged her over to explain the situation.  I explained that the waitress had no help, no one running food, no one filling glasses, no manager checking on the patrons.  Although apologetic she threw the waitress under the bus and wholly blamed her.  Not only was this unprofessional it wasn't true, where the hell was the manager all night?  This was literally the first time we saw her on the floor.  Terrible service, TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT, but maybe they don't teach managing restaurants until high school.

I ordered the filet mignon by default because there wasn't anything else that grabbed my attention.  Also everyone said the steaks were amazing.  When the food got there I was excited.  The steak looked beautiful and when I cut into it, it looked like a perfect medium rare.  I was impressed until I took a bite.  Yikes.  I don't know if it was just the particular piece of meat I had or what but the taste was weird and bad.  It had the taste that steak gets when you try and re-heat it in the microwave.  I tried several bites hoping it would get better and it didn't.  Luckily the monster baked potatoe was great.  I am not sure if my steak was undercooked then they tried to quickly compensate and nuke it real quick.  I have serious doubts that any established steakhouse would do that but.... something was off about my steak.  The boyfriend got the ribs whom the server swore were the best in town. Lies.  Ribs were not fall off the bone tender and not very meaty.  On the positives portions were huge so you get a good value for the price... that is if you like what you're eating.

I have someone who can vouch for me on this.\n\nHead chef notwithstanding, this is an absolute lock.  If you want a delicious dinner (or lunch) there is no question that you'll get it at Houston's.  And I will make the bold claim here: they serve the best cheeseburger in the state.  When the fries are right, they are amazing--thin yet crispy and deliciously salty on the outside but steamy and soft in the middle.  Yet it's the cheeseburger that gets my vote every time.  And this is in spite of the fact that I have had the hawaiian rib eye (amazing), the chicken sandwich (delightful), the prime rib sandwich (a savory taste sensation) and even remember fondly the best pork chops I've ever had at a restaurant, back when they served them.  (Butterflied with--yes--a tab of butter melted across the top of each side.  Fuck.)  But it ain't broke, so every time I get the cheeseburger, medium, no onions, and the juices ooze out to form an oh-so-tempting puddle on my plate--generally the only evidence that something edible even graced the plate in the first place.  Trust me on this.\n\nAppetizers: The smoked salmon appetizer is fucking ridiculously good.  And I don't even like salmon.  Also the chicago-style spinach dip.  For dessert, if they still serve the warm five nut brownie, get it.\n\nSides: if they offer the braised cabbage, go for it.  The brussels sprouts are also a delight.\n\nWait: get over it.  Dress relatively nicely because they claim to have a dress code.\n\nBottom line: one sure way to know if someone is a moron is if they don't like Houston's.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":1}

So, first, we go to order the appetizer. We put in for two appetizers, one including the grilled artichokes (not realizing it is not in season). Our waitress says ok and a little while later one of the appetizers comes out. We ask about the artichokes and she tells us they don't have them it's not in season. Well..why didn't you tell us that 10 minutes ago when we ordered them and you said ok?????\n\nAnyways, then we go to order the entree. My friend orders the Arctic Char, which we were told they were out of as they just sold the last one (it's 6:15p on a Monday). Then the ladies try to order the Prime Rib. Well...turns out the kitchen *just placed a new Rib on the rack and it's going to be 40 minutes if we want that. Keep in mind this is a nice restaurant with a limited menu, so at this point the question really becomes what do you have available? (I was never a waiter, but shouldn't the staff tell you up front about all the menu issues rather than wait for customers to order and then say oh we don't have that?)\n\nThen HERE is the strangest part, although relatively trivial. My friend has a Manhattan and is midway through his drink. Our waitress comes around, doesn't speak, but picks up his cocktail, casually transfers it to a new, chilled glass and walks away. MID COCKTAIL! I would have thought that was weird had she asked to do it, let alone just pickup and mess with someones drink. We had a good laugh about that. I have never seen that before. \n\nAt the end of our meal, our waitress clearly knew we were upset about the menu issues, so she starts laying down forks. We thought the meal was over but turns out they were giving us 2 free desserts for the trouble. I understand and appreciate the gesture, but the 2 desserts that came out were based on the presumption that:\n\n1. We wanted to stay a while longer\n2. We actually wanted dessert\n\nWhy not just comp the $12 appetizer?\n\nIn all, this was not a horrible dinner (food was good) but we don't go out to nice places like this all that often. So, when we do, I think it's fair to expect a level of service that warrants spending north of $100 and this was certainly not the case. While I used to love coming to this restaurant, I doubt we will return. Too many other options just down the street.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

They are definitely a high end steak house so be prepared to spend a little extra but unlike most high end steak houses everything isn't ala cart. I don't mind paying $43 for an amazing steak especially when it comes with equally amazing mash potatoes and broccoli. \n\nOverall, we got an appetizer, prime rib, center cut filet with sides on both and some alcoholic drinks and our bill was a little over $100.

I don't see it on their website anymore, but my coworkers and I would treat ourselves once a month and go to Houston's and enjoy the gracious service, delicious food, and I believe that one had a lovely deck overlooking a pond.  \n\nWhen our anniversary rolled around this year, Houston's came to mind as a place to revisit.  It's still the same classy, comfortable interior and the service is perfect.  Our main server, Russell, was attentive and friendly, and the woman who brought out our appetizer had a quick wit because as she came around the corner I was holding a cocktail in each hand and said, \"I'm having both drinks tonight\" and she said, \"Well you have to taste test them, right?\"  Absolutely!\n\nSpeaking of those cocktails, mine was the elder collins ($13) and it went down way too quickly.  That's a nice summertime drink for sure.  My husband had the Manhattan ($12) which both of us enjoyed (I just had a sip, I swear) and you can tell we don't get out to classier restaurants much because I was so impressed that halfway through the drink, Russell stopped by to pour it into a freshly chilled glass.  That was a nice touch.  \n\nWe then shared the Hawaiian ribeye ($36) which is worth every penny.  Full of flavor and cooked a perfect medium rare, it was fantastic.  We chose fries for the side and those were delicious as well.  We didn't make a reservation, but got there with the geriatric crew and golfers for an early dinner at 4:30 on a Saturday.  We had no problem getting a table then, but by the time we were finished the place was full and people were waiting.  I'm glad to see they are still a wonderful place to go out for dinner.

The first time I went with a friend of mine.  I had their roasted chicken with couscous and we split the hot fudge sundae.  One of the most flavorful roasted chicken and couscous I have ever had.  And the fudge was rich and decadent.  I had it again the second time I went (yesterday) with my husband.  However, I was a little disappointed with the texture of the ice cream the second time.  It was a little bit on the icy side.  It was still really good though.  \n\nMy husband and I also had their Rainbow Roll and their Thai Tuna Roll (sushi).  Also some of the best tasting sushi I have had in the valley, but again I experienced a little bit of a disappointment.  The first roll that came out was the Rainbow Roll, and although it tasted great it was a bit too cold.  Yet, they made up for it with the Thai Tuna Roll -- the perfect temperature.  I also had the Hawaiian Rib Eye (medium rare), my husband had the Prime Rib (medium), and we both had their Cesar Salad.   All of it was very tasty.  The salad was crisp and fresh, with just the right amount of dressing -- thoroughly coating every leaf and not drowning them.  My rib eye was brown and carmalized on the outside and the center was warm and rare without being bloody -- just how a good steak should be. It was marinated in a light terriyaki marinade which gave it great flavor, perhaps a little sweet for my taste buds, but still very good.  I'm more of a savory person.  I can't say anything about the prime rib (I was too busy with my rib eye), but my husband thought his prime rib was very tender, not too fatty, and he thought the horse radish was balanced well so as not to overpower the flavor of the beef.  Our enterees also came with baked potatoes, which were good.  We did not get another side, but I think next time we go I will get a side of their vegetables to cut the richness of everything. We ended with the hot fudge sundae, but next time it will be the peach cobbler.  \nThe staff was also very great.  They were attentive without being overbearing and their smiles felt genuine.\nThe atmosphere is cozy due to the smaller size, lively, and comfortable.  No pretensions anywhere.\nAll in all, a great dinner.  We spent a worthwhile $175 including a bottle of merlot ($36) and 20% tip.  We left stuffed, happy, and a bit buzzed.  LOL.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Anyway, as per usual we were seated about 20 minutes late.  About 4 waiters\/hosts\/etc. came up to us to tell us how truly sorry they were so that was kinda nice.  They even gave us a spinach dip appetizer (my wife's absolute fav) on the house so that more than made up for being seated later than we should have.\n\nI ordered the Caesar salad to start and it was excellent as always.  I LOVE the croutons.  For an entree I had the ribs per my wife's recommendation.  My wife is a huge Houston's fan and has been there dozens more times than I so I trusted her opinion on this.

My wife got the halibut and it was just ok.  It was very plain but she enjoyed it so that's what counts.  Our friend had the filet and it looked excellent.

The cole slaw was not as good as I remember, but that's a minor point (apologies to slaw aficionados!) The salmon was perfectly prepared and delicious. For dessert, we had the key lime pie which was not overly sweet, and had a nice balanced lime flavor; and some kind of hot brownie concoction with ice cream...yummmm.

The spinach dip is a must on the list of starters regardless of the calories that come with it. I've enjoyed the chopped salad with a side of honey mustard.

RIP Racket Club. However, the normal club is good too and you can never go wrong with the Biltmore Chicken Sandwich and their ribs are famous too. For dessert, my personal favorite is the Apple cobbler but apparently it's seasonal and so they will switch it out for the Key Lime Pie.

I had the ahi tuna salad (was torn between that or the thai noodle salad, but daughter voted for this one and I think I was going to share some with her, is why I must have let her help me decide this time?).

I've had plenty of better french dips at local bars, for half the price. We also requested extra crispy french fries, which came out pretty soggy.\n\nI ordered the thai steak salad. I LOVE thai everything, but this salad was just a smorgasbord  of clashing flavors. The filet in my salad was also very salty. Not a very well thought out dish, was only able to eat half of it. \n\nAll in all, not worth the price. Disappointing.  Won't be back.","useful":1,"funny":3,"cool":0}

The best way to start out your experience is with a grilled artichoke.  I don't know how they do it but the flavor is like no other.  The filet is one of the best in town and if you want an amazing French dip sandwich, you must try it here.  The fries are freshly cut and made and are out of this world.  The Thai steak salad with mango is one of the best if you want something lighter.  For dessert, the only option you must choose is the hot fudge Sunday.

I understand not everything can come out perfectly every time. However something I do expect to be handled properly each time is customer service and management failed miserably yet again.

Every time I go it is great. I have never left feeling unsatisfied or pissed because I spent money on food that was terrible. I am sure this is one of the reasons why Houston's has been around for a long time. \n\nFor starters go with the Spinach Dip. Best I have ever had! They give you sour cream and salsa to mix it up a bit, but I am a purest and stick with just the chips and the dip. They have a somewhat limited selection of beers, but offer the main stays of domestic lights. They also have a beer I have grown to love, Sessions. It's an American lager, similar to Stella in taste. It comes in what looks like a Red Stripe bottle. \n\nThe service at this location has always been great. They are very attentive and are always there to fill up your water or see if you need another drink. There can be a wait here so make reservations or be prepared to wait. There is a bar to wait and grab a drink beforehand, which always makes the time go by faster. \n\nNormally I get the Ahi Tuna entree, when they have it. It comes seared, so rare, but I look mine a little more well done and the staff is always accommodating. The seasonal vegetables that are served with most of the entrees are fresh and either steamed or sauteed perfectly, plus they put a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top. Good touch. I have had the cheeseburger also. It has slowly grown on me. I didn't like it at first, but it is tasty. The fries are great too. I have also had the dirty rice and beans on the side. Black beans and white rice. Nice compliment if you are having a small salad or something. \n\nCan't say that I have had dessert. I think most of their choices have nuts in them.

Hostess was named Emily.  She suggested 2 booths, we declined.  She then said there was one large table but she could not reserve as it was first come, first served.

We declined as asked about the table.

And they had one of our favorite wines on the list, Jeff Runquist.  The couple at the neighboring table also ordered the same bottle.  We ordered our favorite sushi, the coconut shrimp roll.  The consistency was all there!  Perfect, fresh and delicious.  Husband ordered the filet with a baked potato.  It looked measly when it arrived, dwarfed by the gigantic potato.  But the filet was nothing but tasty, perfectly grilled beefiness.  The potato was a bit dry inside.  I ordered my usual California Sushi Salad.  Huh?  What.....did they get the order mixed up?  This was not my usual CA Sushi Salad.  Beware, the salad is different here than in CA.  Completely different sushi.

Whenever I'm in town, I make a point to stop in. The quality of the food is phenomenal (and the prices are in line with that) and the service is usually top-notch. The atmosphere is Southwestern Swanky so you get that cool, old school vibe. The leather booths and dark lighting gives it a classy, mysterious setting.\n\nI'm a low carb eater so my go-to menu item is their cheeseburger (sans bun) with the vegetable of the day (make sure to ask what the veggies are and if they say spaghetti squash or brussels sprouts, ORDER THEM! They are by far my favorite). Their standard veggies, or ones they usually have all year, are sauteed spinach or broccoli with Parmesan cheese on top. The burgers are SO GOOD here because they grind them fresh in-house. You'll be paying close to $15 for one, but they are tasty.\n\nI prefer to eat here at lunch time on the weekends when it's not so crowded. Evenings tend to feel a bit too \"formal\" and the place gets packed with the worker crowd during lunch hours on weekdays. Plus, if you go on Saturday, they have their awesome chili!

Geez, I like this place a lot, it's one of the few restaurants where if I had the option, I would eat there every day. \n\n      We had reservations for 6:45 and were quickly greeted and sat right down. The place is always lively, always a crowd and always a little noisy, just the way it should be. I got a tasty Jack and Diet and she a glass of white wine as we started with their famous spinach dip. Nowadays it seems every restaurant is throwing a dip of some type together, but none come within thirty feet of the deliciousness that is the Houston's spinach dip. Their chips are crispy and fresh, the spinach dip itself is so flavorful and thick and has big chunks of artichoke in it, it also comes with a side of both salsa and sour cream which compliment the dip beautifully. What a treat! \n\n      On to the main course! I moved over to a beer for the entree, Sierra Nevada Heff I think, mighty fine, and the lady stuck with the wine. I ordered the Hawaiian rib-eye (I'm drooling just typing it) and Kristen had the prime rib, both ordered medium rare. My rib-eye was absolutely incredible... the outside simply burst with this delicious Hawaiian marinade, goodness, if only I could describe the flavor, and the inside was cooked perfectly to my taste, the meat was tender and bursting with its own cow goodness. I could only manage one bite before shoving a taste in the mouth of my partner, who also declared it a natural wonder. The steak came with a potato but I opted for fries with a side of homemade buttermilk ranch for dipping. I could write a novel on these delicious fries, but just try them, get a side of their homemade ketchup as well, wow. Her prime rib was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Cooked very well, lots of meat, tasty, tender and came with a savory au jus sauce, bursting with goodness. She had the potato which came with the prime rib and looked like a football covered in cheese and bacon (not bacon bits, big chunks of bacon), and man was it good. I occasionally wondered if I chose wrong with the fries, but I didn't, shoot, order them both I say! \n\n      The only sort of negative of the night was our waitress, she just happened to be new and a little naive, or careful maybe? She was overly cautious about our age, checking our IDs more than once (I'm 28) and forgetting our drink orders twice. I completely forgive this, it was busy, she was new and had several tables, no big deal at all, she was a sweetheart. \n\n      If you have never visited Houston's, I highly recommend it, they have many dinner options and even a sushi bar!

There were no other meat options that looked appealing on the limited menu so I ended up getting the pork chop. The pork chop is very thick and has a very burnt crust. The sides were mediocre, a baked potato and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes taste like the kind made from flakes. Yuck. \nThere are no kid friendly Options so my daughter got the chicken tender plate which was horrible.  Definitely not worth the $17. \nThey serve soda from a bottle which is ridiculous! The lemonade is so bitter I got heart burn with every sip. \nThe service was ok not what I expected for the prices. Our waitress told us to stack our menus at the end of the table when we are ready to order. This was really strange to me. I like to have my menu in front of me when I'm ordering so I dont have to memorize what I want. How hard is it to check in like every other waitress. \n\nBottom line this is not my scene.

Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.\n\nLast night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.\n\nI've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.  \n\n4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation. \n\nIf you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP.

Went in on a whim - and SO glad we did.\nThe staff was fantastic and well-trained, to the point that they visibly cleared a path when you walked down the aisle to the restroom - it was a bit more than 'just' stepping aside.\nIt was lunch, we'd already had a snack so really weren't looking for a big meal. The menu wasn't huge, but there were great choices.\n\nI had the (I believe it's called) \"Flying Chicken\" and my hubby had a burger (I think it was a barbecue burger). He says his burger was perfect and full of flavor. The chicken tenders were SO very lightly battered and fried, thus the 'flying' reference in the name. They were cooked perfectly. The chicken tenders were served with two sauces, honey mustard and BBQ. The chicken was so good that I tried the sauces, just for the sake of trying them, but didn't use them beyond the initial taste (but they were good).\n\nThe burger came with fries, I didn't even ask the hubs what he thought about them. He said he was VERY pleased at the end of the meal - so I'll suggest he thought they were good. The chicken tenders were served with a tasty slaw. I'll almost bet they made it themselves, it doesn't taste anything like any I've had before.\n\nThe place was comfortable, comfortable living room-like wood and dark colors. But it wasn't so dark that you couldn't see who was sitting in front of you. If you have a chance, I highly suggest you go. We'll be back again, perhaps for dinner next time.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We came for lunch and it was surprisingly not busy. We had a baby with us and instead of using high chairs, they have one that connects to the table. I like that so much more because then the baby isn't sticking out in the aisle and they can feel included in the meal as well and right by mom\/dad\/whomever. They offer a very large bar with some craft cocktails. Only 2 of us were drinking and only one get a cocktail. It was a moscow mule. The drink itself was good, nothing over the top and it didn't come in a copper cup. They do have a good wine selection, somewhat limited in by the glass options but I made due and got a really nice Sav Blanc from New Zealand. I will say the pour is a little heavy and I love it! As for the food, 2 people split the Hawaiian ribeye as per the recommendation of our server. The portion was large for one person so it was perfect for 2. They asked for medium and it came medium with some parts a little medium rare so they were very happy. The char on it was perfect. My husband got the famous french dip. It was enormous. I think it was about 6 inches thick and mostly meat. It also looked like it was freshly sliced meat because it didn't have that dark brown crusted edge to it but was pink and clean cut. It was excellent. The portion was also huge, he struggled to finish it. Finally, I got the Thai steak salad and wow! I can't wait to go back and get it again. The amount of dressing was just right, it had a great spice to it but not enough that I wanted to grab water every few seconds. The portion was very large but I had no problem finishing it and basically licking the plate after. I would highly recommend this one. We finished the meal with their famous ice cream sundae. Before you laugh, it was more than enough for 4 of us to share and they give you a gravy boat of hot fudge on the side. Did you hear me- a GRAVY boat full of fudge.

We meet 2 to 3 times per week at various Scottsdale locations for lunch.  No fast food.  Nicer places.  We sit at the bar, have ice tea and lunch.\nWe go up to the bar and begin taking a seat when the bartender asks me if I have another shirt as they do not allow tank tops.  Everyday for the past 25 years in my own business I wear a company tank top and gym shorts.  I gave up the suit and tie a long time ago.  In the approximately 3,750 times I have eaten lunch out in the past 25 years I have NEVER been told I could not be there due to my tank top.  It was clean, no stains and I am clean cut and clean shaven.  \nTo top it off the two women next to us were wearing tank tops?  Well, the joke is on them because every week my wife and mother -in-law meet for dinner there.  I get the credit card bill so I know that HOUSTON'S will now be short an average of $208 per week as the ladies will no longer be going there.\nWe went across the lot to the tap house and had a nice lunch and the manager laughed at our houston's story and was glad to have our business.  I highly recommend the TAP HOUSE.  I have told literally ALL of my friends to cease going to HOUSTON'S because apparently if you are a successful contractor you are NOT welcome there if you are dressed casual.

At $25 to $30 for nearly every entrée, it's not such a great deal.  There is almost always a better choice nearby from my experience.\n\nIn short, a great place to take someone unadventurous who is more comfortable at a chain restaurant than an owner-operated place, which is why it's so popular for corporate type lunches and travelers I guess.\n\nIt's fine for corporate events, but when I'm spending my own money, I'd much rather eat at Ruth's Chris or Arnie Morton's, which are only slightly more expensive but much nicer.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":2}

I asked my sister to make reservations at her favorite restaurant and she decided on Houston's. She was raving about their Hawaiian Rib-eye that she always orders from them. She was excited to take me here bc she loves food just as much as I do (especially a good filet steak). We arrived five minutes early for our reservation and the hostess asked if we were a party of three and my sister replied yes. The hostess then responded that it will be about a 15 minute wait. My sister then told her we had a reservation here, after I said \"Wait, don't we have a reservation?\". My sister assumed that they recognized her bc she comes here that often. We got seated right away and the night started off right. The ambiance is really nice and we got asked for beverages pretty quickly. We ordered as soon as we got our beverages bc we already knew what we wanted. We ordered the Home Smoked Salmon, Hawaiian Ribeye (for my sister and her fiancé to share bc they are on a 'diet'), side of Seasonal Veggies, USDA Prime Center-Cut Filet, and 2 beers. I ordered my filet to be Medium RARE. The smoked salmon came out first and It was OK but my sister loved it. Next our entrees came out... the top of my steak was pretty BLACK. When I cut in to the steak I already knew it was bad. It cut like how you think a thick beef jerky might cut. But I thought maybe the taste will make up for it... I was wrong! The steak tasted like beef charcoal. I then asked my sister and the fiancé to try it, thinking maybe I was going crazy. But they agreed that the steak was charred. My sister insisted that I tell our waitress, but I didn't have the heart to. Next thing I knew she flagged our waitress down and told her the situation. She agreed that the steak was over cooked but also mentioned that all their steaks were normally charred. I do not believe that anybody would eat a steak that taste like that! She apologized and said she will bring a new one right out. She took my plate away plus my utensils and I had to sit there watching them eat their food. I didn't have utensils to even take a bite of what they had. My sister offered a bite so I took one off her fork. But they were sharing a plate so I didn't want to eat the little they had. My plate FINALLY came after they already finished their plate. The manager (I assumed he was bc he was wearing a suit) put the plate down and apologized again and asked me to cut through the steak to make sure it was to my liking. He was awkwardly hovering so I felt rushed to roll-out my new utensils out of my napkin and felt rushed to cut through it. I have to say the steak was prepared much better. So I sat there eating my plate ALONE for the next 15 minutes. It was a really undesirable experience. Instead of having normal family conversations, it became more about the restaurant and the steak. We all agreed that for a higher-end restaurant such as Houston's we would expect something to be on the house. But we got our bill and everything was there. Nothing was comped, not even the side seasonal veggies. They did nothing to make up for it. I told my sister that I was disappointed on her choice of restaurant and now she is a little upset even though I was the one who got the short end of the stick. I still gave her a 15% tip bc it wasn't her fault for my piece of charcoal. My sister is going to have to rethink her favorite restaurant.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Drinks took abnormally long to come out and refills were slow to be completed. Food order was taken and I asked that my steak be seasoned with Cajun season before it's cooked. The server said they were not able to do it, which I found odd since it was done for us three months ago. I asked that an inquiry be made with the Chef. The server returned and said they can bring it to me on the side but not season it with it. Anyone who has ever cooked a steak knows you have to season it before the cook. \nAt any rate our food comes out around 20 minutes later. After about 12 minutes we flagged a manager down to get refills and missing condiments. He returned seconds later dropped off the refills and just walked away without asking if we needed anything else. Like a replacement potato since the ones we received were cold or to check on the steaks that were somehow overcooked and cold at the same time. Another 20 minutes later the server appeared and asked about desserts.

It was my favorite restaurant. Today was a disaster. I ordered the Hickory burger. I ordered it medium well, when it arrived it was bloody. Then I noticed that the Canadian bacon had been replaced with some limp fatty bacon.  I would never quibble about paying 15 dollars, because it was that good.  There was a very small serving of limp greasy fries.  What happened? Is Houston's trying to save a few pennies on my burger?\nI would rather spend $16 on a quality burger. That is why I have been so loyal to Houstons.  Now let me move on to the service. I feel like I walked into a different restaurant. I waited 10 minutes with an empty glass before I had to flag down whoever I could find.  After I received the disappointing burger, I asked if I could exchange it for the French dip. They obliged and of course upped my charge to $19.  French dip had also changed, now they have gone with a piece of french  bread as opposed to the prior oversized croissant.

It's not just the amazingly consistently delicious food they run out of their open clean kitchen.  It's the ambiance... the artwork, the live jazz bands, the fireplace, the candles, the beautiful wood that remains timeless and not to mention the smell of a wood burning oven.  It's nice to get out of the blazing sun and retreat to a cool place where it's relaxing atmosphere and excellent food welcomes you back, as you are greeted at the door by a smiling face.  Houston's seems to have a wonderful waitstaff that is extremely professional and attentive.  I have been to this locations several times and thought it was time I finally review it.  Since 2007 is when my love for Houston's developed.  I find their waitstaff is wonderful and provide the best consistent service through out the years.  AMAZING!!  \n\nNow let's talk food!!  One of my favorites is the Famous French dip.  Now I have also watched the price of this delicious sandwich go up and up through the years.  It's still worth it!!  Especially if you look at it as a special sandwich not one you'd want to eat every other day.  The special being, the tender rare perfectly seasoned prime rib sliced thin served on a delicious buttery, shiny,  french roll with au jus.  I love the horseradish with it!!  I love their french fries or the loaded baked potato.   Since I have been to Houston's many times over the years I have many favorites.  I love the Spinach artichoke dip. The grilled Artichokes, so great.  I have also had their smoked salmon-which is, smoked in house (I'm  told).  It's the best damn salmon ever!!   I will sometimes just order it as a meal. The variety of salads with fresh produce and combinations of exotic ingredients makes for great lunch.  Pick one, they are all amazing.  As of lately, I have tried a new sandwich they put on their menu called Ding's Crispy Chicken sandwich.  It was the BEST!!!  The coleslaw on the sandwich makes it cool and crunchy fresh.  The bun once again is just buttery and delicious.  It also is a nice size sandwich. Their burgers are great as well.  My boyfriend says they are one of the best, cooking it perfectly juicy. The flying Chicken and the BBQ pork ribs are some of my favorites.  The fish dishes are always fresh tasting including their fish sandwiches that are done to flaky perfection.  Their sauces are also great...house made and well seasoned, the green goddess sauce, the spicy garlic aioli to dip fries in are just the perfect compliment to the quality of food that's being dipped. Houston's has it covered all the way around.  That's what makes it a great place!!  They have paid attention to the smallest details that making dining a pleasure with them. Right down to the clean and modern restrooms they have exceeded all expectations.\n\nI usually am to stuffed to enjoy their delicious desserts... however, I have had their apple walnut cobbler. It's seasonal.. in the fall.  It's truly a taste of fall. Just try it!!!   The key lime pie is really wonderful as well.  The coffee is the best in town.  The smell of it through out the restaurant is enough to make me order every time.  Houston's crosses it's T and dots it's I's in the restaurant\/culinary world with every thing they do!!!  Thank you for your fabulous service and constant attention to detail, it shows!!!  I can't wait to come back again!!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Once I started eating it I noticed that the chicken was raw and bloody. After showing the waitress she didn't apologize and the manager never came over. They removed it from the check but still for my favorite restaurant to be so unprofessional about this situation left a bad taste in my mouth.","useful":0,"funny":2,"cool":0}

So my wife and I eat at Houston's several times a month. I always have the cheeseburger done medium well (no overcooked jokes please). Last night we took our friends for dinner and drinks and I have to say it was disappointing from the start. \n\nFirst, while waiting for a table we decided to begin what we thought would be our first of MANY margaritas, however, that didn't pan out because these were not the delicious frothy drinks we are so used to; instead, they were very strong (I know, why am I complaining about that?) but it wasn't like a 'too much tequila' strong, it was more like 'someone didn't make the mix right and the wrong flavors are coming out' strong. We switched our drinks and that was that.\n\nLater, while seated at our table and as we waited for our food to arrive the waitress brought by a margarita made with a new (I suppose) batch of mix and..... yes! This one was done right so we ordered a few more.\n\nSo finally our food arrives. I am almost done eating the first half of my burger and then realize that the meat is very undercooked. I try to brave it and not complain again so I shove the last piece of that half's burger in my mouth and reluctantly swallow it. As I'm done chewing, the waitress stops by and I take the opportunity to show her my second half which is also undercooked. She agreed and said she will have it fixed. \n\nNow I want to make something clear. I don't eat super pink\/red meat for two reasons: 1. to me, it's gross and 2. I have Crohn's and have flared up from it before.\n\nAnyway, along comes the manager, very apologetic, and puts in front of me A HALF OF A CHEESEBURGER! Yes, i assume it was the cheeseburger they took to finish cooking! My friends, my wife and I were in awe! We could not believe that 1. They took my burger apart, cooked the half of the cheeseburger, cut up HALF A BUN and added HALF THE CHEESE and HALF THE TOPPINGS and brought it to me!! 2. Lest I repeat they TOOK THE MEAT OFF MY PLATE, cooked it on the same grill where other people's food was being cooked and brought it back - how did they know I didn't lick it or spit on it? 3. This, from what Bon Appetit magazine called \"The Best Run Restaurant in the Country\"!\n\nWow! We were dumbfounded that Houston's wouldn't just replace it with a fresh new burger. I should mention they DID bring extra asparagus on the house.\n\nNow, Houston's - or any restaurant for that matter, should appreciate feedback from customers like us. We are there many times each month and therefore, we know what to expect in terms of service and quality - this time, it was not up to par. Unfortunately, over the last few times it has not been up to par with things going wrong here and there. Sure everyone makes mistakes, but lately the mistakes have become more and more instead of less and this is why I can't, as much as I'd like to, give them 5 stars. \n\nOne last thing - a tip more so: when you ask for ketchup, make sure you ask them to \"fill it up\" otherwise they will bring you a half full container which won't be enough for your fries and I which think is so petty like maybe make more if you think you're gonna run out. Smh.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I'm glad we went there for dinner.\nI may have eaten at nearly every Houston's in North America over the past 15 years, and sometimes it just seems a little bit repetitious...it's the same menu in Minneapolis, Charlotte, Milwaukee, and Left Overshoe, Nebraska. But...I think that's the genius of it!\nI like their French Dip sandwich, I like their burgers, I like their ribs, I like their soups and salads, I like they way they pour a cocktail (perfect vodka martini tonight, BTW...ice cold...like a comforting fog made of vodka...mmmmm...vodka).\nAnyway, I realized that I like pretty much everything I've ever had at Houston's and that I can get pretty much everything I've ever had at A Houston's at THIS Houston's! Genius!\nThe service is attentive and now that they take ressie's, the lengthy wait for a spot in the restaurant can be a thing of the past.\nI do have one small quibble with the service (and it really is a quibble). I just don't really like being interrupted during my second bite to be asked \"is everything wonderful?\" It's just kind of presumptuous to ask the \"wonderful\" part, in the first place, and the wonder doesn't really kick in until I've had a few more bites...then I will be happy to let you know it was wonderful! As I say, just a quibble...they were just trying to be sure we were happy...and we were!\nFinally, a word about sushi at Houston's...the word is \"really?\" I love sushi, but this may be the only thing on Houston's menu that I have not tried. I just think it's reaching. When I walk into a Houston's, \"raw\" and \"fish\" aren't top of mind. But, more sushi for you guys!\nAll in all, Houston's (all the millions and millions of locations, but esp. you, local Scottsdale location) is a solid lunch and dinner spot. It won't cost you and arm and a leg for a really decent meal in a nice relaxing atmosphere. It may not be the greatest grub you'll ever have, but it's pretty damn good! Thanks for getting me out there tonight, partner!","useful":5,"funny":4,"cool":4}

The octopus was so thick it couldn't be chewed literally had to spit out in my napkin (the ones I usually have to go in the back to get myself, on more than one occasion) Then we ordered a couple of special items (they made us these dishes on their own for us to try when we were trying this place out) fail. If you make someone something special to try and they like it, and they order again and again and then it's not the same or even close to all the other times ... What changed?

When we're paying the price for all you can eat, I would expect to get everything I wanted... especially when the menu doesn't have much to offer compared to all the other all you can eat sushi places. A couple other things too... one of the male waiters seemed a bit rude and we felt rushed when we were putting orders in and our waters were refilled only when we were sucking nothing but drips of water through the straws.

When we did get the waters we were constantly out of water to drink (cup was 90% ice and had little water to begin with when they brought to us), we sipped ice cubes for relief because despite the fact there was more than enough staff, they were too busy chatting about their personal life issues.  They actually looked at us, then ignored our arms in the air trying to wave them over or even when we got up and asked for service!  The soup was good but is was mostly liquid and not much content in it so not filling at all, the meat was overcooked to almost beyond eating (think dried jerky meat), and the sushi was good quality cut meat but warm.

The atmosphere was great, not crowded, no blaring music, clean and very friendly staff.  Had the pleasure of Nick as the sushi chef and Joe as our server.  Both were courteous, friendly, and efficient with our orders.  All food was very good.  Had poke salad, nigiri, and for our first visit Nick made most orders a half roll so we could try many items.  Everything was very tasty.  Only thing I did not like was that some of the rolls that were torched were tasty, but had a little fuel after taste, and as some other reviewers have mentioned, the nigiri was microscopic in size.  I have only come across one other sushi joint that served this way.  The salmon belly was very tasty, but four pieces were only equal to one regular order that you would receive elsewhere.  Other than those minor issues we would definitely go back again.  \n\nNick also surprised us a couple times with items we did not order.  He made an off menu item called the 10K, and another one called The Black Widow.  Both very tasty.  Will give a second try later and see how it goes.  A tad on the high side price wise compared to other sushi places along this Cheyenne Ave. corridor.  $21.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner, both AYCE.  \n\nGreat job Nick and Joe.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Once found, however, *it is a great find.*  I was so pleased to still be accommodated for all you can eat at 10pm (in a local neighborhood).  The interior is simple and clean, the staff was warm and inviting.  The music is contemporary, but, kept a level condusive for conversation, allowing for a nice, sophisticated vibe.  The server was knowledgeable, explained all the essentials from the onset, and, stayed posted at the front of the restaurant facing guests.  I happened in to this place on a night where I was dining by myself, and, and, felt not one bit out of place as there were several other women also dining solo, and, none of us were distracted from our meals in any way. \n\nI ordered a series of items, the sushi chefs were quick, and, personable.  My choices included the poke, the salmon handroll, and, the house specialty (half) roll.  All of my dishes tasted so light and well prepared - with no heavy sauces or mayonnaise.  I truly wish I was capable of eating more - as the chefs continued to encourage.  I felt I'd had a most satisfying meal, and, left with a re-exhuberation of all you can eat.  I was completely satisfied, and, not in want of anything.\n \nI used to come here often with the prior ownership, but, am so happy to have rediscovered it!  For anyone looking to for all you can eat in this area, I totally recommend!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

It took literally 30 seconds of myself and my wife standing there at the entrance before he even acknowledged us.  No hostess was present or seen at this time.\n\nUpon being seated, this same employee came to get our drink order and asked if we wanted to order anything from the kitchen.  The hostess finally came out after almost 10 minutes and took our sushi order.  \n\nVery sub par food.  Rice for our nigiri sushi was smaller in size but was cold and chewy, as in just came out of the refrigerator cold.  Maybe trying to use up some old rice that was left over?  Salmon and tuna was just \"ok\", quality not up to par with other ayce sushi places.  Against our better judgement we ordered 1 more order of tuna nigiri.  Rice was better but not really.  We mostly got filled on appetizers, of which the selection is very small.\n\nNeedless to say we will not be back nor can I recommend this place.  Service is severely lacking, along with serving cold and chewy sushi rice.  We had high hopes for this place, especially since our friend Manny had such good reviews.

The staff, right off the bat, was super friendly and joked around with their customers. I was kinda anxious about their AYCE rules with 1 hr and 15 min time limit for dinner! Haha! Not that I plan on \"camping in\". I can't eat as fast I want to! No one wants to choke while eating their meal! \n\nAppetizers: 5\/5\nPoke salad was garnished with some seaweed. It was fresh and delicious with just the right amount of dressing in it. Other locations dredge their poke salad with the sauce and that's one of my pet peeves. \nTuna carpaccio was super yummy! Love the mild sweet sauce with a kinda garlicky taste to it served with mayo underneath.\nAmaebi was one of the best I've had! Love the lightly breaded flavorful shrimp heads! \n\nNigiri: 3.5\/5\nSalmon belly, eel, and tuna were really fresh, but my first few pieces of the nigiri, sushi rice was a little bit undercooked. Rice to fish ratio was awesome! Perfectly sliced thickness with VERY small amount of rice! We will see IF the second visit will be the same ratio.\n\nSushi Rolls: 4\/5\nThe only sushi roll I ordered from the menu was the Sasa. It has shrimp tempura, spicy crab, cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. The sauces were mayo, sriracha, and eel sauce. I really like it a lot, but it could have been better if the shrimp tempura had some crunch to it. The rest of the special rolls I've had were made by Nick who was superb! I was game for anything he can create! And oh boy did he impress me! \n\nSmall cut of sashimi served in the traditional Asian soup spoon with a sweet hint of sauce was delicious! This creation was repeated, but this time it was served on fried crunchy edible leaves. The next roll he whipped up was a tuna roll with tuna, crab, and scallops. It was garnished with super creamy sauce and jalepeno for added heat.\n\nDeserts: 3.5\/5\nYuzu sorbet! It's about time someone gave me a full scoop of this goodness! Most places either give you about a tablespoon or it looks like a full scoop, but it's hollow inside. Really? You think I can't tell the difference?!? LMAO! \nGreen tea tempura ice cream was just \"okay\". Green tea was weak in flavor and not as creamy as other green tea ice cream I've had.\n\nI would definitely come back since I barely tried out their menu selections, but I would probably not come here with a large group since there is a time limit of 75 minutes. BTW, they have happy hour with 20% off their a la carte sushi rolls from 2pm-5pm.","useful":6,"funny":3,"cool":6}

About a 15 minute wait. No problem, it's a small place. We were seated and given menus and we placed orders but didn't receive our first roll until nearly 30 minutes after we ordered. \n\nI believe the reason for this is the place was just slammed. They got unlucky and a whole bunch of people showed up at once and the orders poured in. Nobody left for the first half and hour we were there. They've got to streamline their back of house to take care of this situation. The food was trickling out of the bar when there were four guys back there. \n\nThe servers did a great job of making sure everyone was as happy as possible but there is only but so much servers can do when there is no food. On top of it more than a few tables got rolls they didn't order, I myself got a double order when I clearly placed one order. This kind of stuff just snowballs inefficiency and really adds up. Some of the rolls were very tasty. My favorite was the mango crunch. It was fresh and new and different. On the other hand other rolls were very lazily made. One of my rolls wasn't sealed and fell apart every time I picked up a piece. Another roll was sloppy and clunky and made eating a mouthful at a time impossible. \n\nThe food was good though. The nigiri was fresh and the portions of fish were generous. The free house sake with check in was great. \n\nAt times some of the servers seemed a bit unprofessional and were scratching and moving in odd ways. Nothing devious of nasty, just not the demeanor a pro server should have. \n\nOverall If this place tightened up the rough edges just a bit this is an easy 5 star for me. It was worth the money to try. I'd recommend going when it's not busy. Lunchtime or a weekday.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":2}

We came on a Friday night and the place was pretty busy. It is very apparent that the staff does not know how to handle busy peaks. We had three semi clueless people servicing our table. It was very bizarre. \n\nWe ordered three rolls, an order of nigiri, and green mussels. One of the three servers brings out the \"Mussels\".I point out that we ordered mussels and he informs that's what was in front of us.  I politely inform him that in fact I have seen a mussel or two in my day, and this was some type of a leaf tempura, not mussels. He looks confused, then he rushes off and comes back to inform us that it's really a complimentary chef's creation, and our mussels were going to be out shortly. Wow. I mean how could you even confuse the two? \n\nThe fish was not fresh and the creations were pretty much all the same thing. The service was extremely lackluster and a toddler slipped and fell as the family was leaving. They promptly grabbed the \"wet floor\" sign and put it up.

Gave a second chance with unfortunately the same results.  For all-you can eat menu, it's much less than other similar venues that offer a bigger menu and better quality.  The real trick here is assuming you have steady service throughout your meal.  Here however, they like to disappear for long periods of time.  Seems convenient for an all you can eat option that they want to slow your ordering.  I'd say this was just coincidence, but again second visit with the same service.  For $26 each, I expect to be able to order more off of your lesser menu.  My bad, but no worries, we won't be back.   We brought family here from out of town and had to apologize for our selection.  Lesson learned.  Mango Mochi at the end slightly improved the experience, but not enough to move out of the 2 star rating.  PS--Waiting on Check now for 20 mins without anyone approaching the table.

It has a combination of tuna, yellowtail, and salmon along with some seaweed salad. Which is why I always get it whenever we come. Their mango crunch roll is also a good one to try if you're into the sweet and savory, the first time we went there, our waitress recommended it and I was skeptical at first because of the mango and cream cheese combo, but I was sold on it!

When I went to Sasa Sushi today for lunch, I walked in at 12:10pm and I was the only person in the restaurant, other than 2 sushi chefs, the host\/waiter and what I believe to be the owner. \nSo there I am one person with the honor of having 4 individuals tend to my sushi needs. Under these circumstances, you would believe the sushi I was about to ingest would be amazing, why not, without any other tables or orders to distract the sushi chef from my order, I was sure I was in for a sushi experience like no other. \n\nI immediately asked for extra wasabi and my waiter Ronald was quick to respond, nothing fancy mind you like you would normally see in other restaurants, just a small round plate with ginger and wasabi just thrown on the plate, very messy presentation. So I began to mix my normal soy sauce with wasabi and noticed the wasabi had no heat, so I added even more wasabi in an attempt to make it hotter and to no avail. The wasabi was clearly not fresh; I ended up with a paste so thick in an attempt to get some heat that you would have thought I was mixing grout for bathroom tile work. \n\nI ordered the Poke Salad and it appeared very nice but I was a little taken back by the sweetness.  I then ordered the Kamikaze Roll and my usual Unagi Hand Roll so that I can gauge the quality of fresh fish to come by sampling the fresh water eel, oh my god, I nearly passed out with disgust as to what was brought to my table.  The eel was burnt, cold and just simply hard to chew; the only other eel in my life that tasted even remotely similar to this was what I once found in a can in the supermarket. Being the only person in the restaurant, the eel should have been freshly broiled and come to my table still warm, instead it was cold, burnt and had a consistency of beef jerky. I would be embarrassed if I took a client here, ashamed really. \n\nI ended up sending both the eel hand role and the spicy tuna hand role back when they arrived because nearly 80% of the roll was rice and virtually no protein. Again, the eel was horrible, If I had to lay money down and bet, I would say the eel came from a can and was not fresh at all.  \n\nI went on to order Albacore and it came out dry and looked like someone had already chewed it and put it back on the plate (cuts all across the fish). I also ordered the Surf Clam and this came out slimy, surf clam never has a slimy sheen on it unless it's old. \nI was trying so hard to make this place work, I tried as much as I could to see if I could find something on the menu to make the trip to Sasa Sushi enjoyable and worth it, but I just couldn't. \n\nI ordered the Salmon Skin hand roll and it was the worst I had ever tasted in my life, the Salmon Skin was pieces of skin about 4-5inches long sticking out of the hand roll, not 1 or 2 pieces but what appeared to be the whole damn salmon, it was truly overkill. When I bight into the Salmon Skin hand roll, there was such a load crunch I believe people were looking around to see if metal was crumpling from a car accident outside. It was awful, I felt like I was eating a pork rind hand roll, it was way to crunchy and just too much of it. I then ordered the PCH Roll thinking, not too complicated, it's a roll with only three little letters for a name, so I thought to myself, as long as there wasn't any more of that dreadful eel in the roll, maybe this roll will be a winner. Who knew, how do you screw up a roll that has Tuna, Salmon, Cream Cheese and Avocado; simple, cut the pieces so big you need someone without just in case you need someone to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on you when you choke. Only 6 piece came out where there should have been 8 and possible 10 for a cut roll, the pieces were just too thick to be enjoyable, nobody wants that much cream cheese in their mouth at one time, unless you're sitting down to put the hurt on a lox bagel. \n\nSushi is about freshness, textures, flavors, combinations of flavors and the perfect balance of vinegar rice to raw fish. If any of these are not correct, it ruins the entire sushi experience.  \n\nSasa Sushi reminds me of amateur hour at the Laugh Factory, although they did get a laugh out of me, as I said when I opened, what a Joke. I couldn't believe I was actually paying money for this crap, just about anyone could read a book at home and learn how to cut, prepare and assemble better tasting sushi than Asaa sushi. Don't waste your time and money going here, there's just not enough customers for the fish to be fresh, hence the Unagi in a can, slimy Surf Clam and already chewed Albacore.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1}

I put in sushi near me and this place popped up. It had good reviews for the most part, so we thought why not? \n\nI'm glad we decided to check this place out. The food was amazing. My boyfriend is very picky. He only likes to go to Yama Sushi, but I convinced him to try this place and try new rolls and he was amazed. We asked what rolls were recommended and tried all the ones they told us about and I dont have anything bad to say about any of them. We just went for it and tried a bunch of their rolls and all were worth it. I like red bean ice cream, but am iffy about the grainy beans in it, but I tried it here and it was better than I've ever had at any other sushi place. There were a lot more we wanted to try, but ran out of room in our bellies for anymore. Lol\n\nOne complaint I had that dropped my rating down, was the time it took to receive our food. We ordered a bunch of stuff right away because we knew some things take longer than others to get. Well, a few things we waited and waited for, at least 30 minutes, and nothing. We finally asked and they forgot to put them in, yet never came to check on us after they saw all our plates were empty for awhile. Their service could definitely be improved, to make sure customers are getting waited on quickly, but we will definitely try it again. By the time we were leaving the place was packed and people were waiting outside, but when we got there, there were a lot of open tables, so you may want to go on an off hour and not dinner time, if you don't want to wait.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":2}

We loved it and the guys that work there.  That being said this is what happened yesterday to me and my husband!\nWe walked in and went to the \"bar\" area, ordered two beers and one glass of ice water.  As always the waiter said, \"are you having AYCE?\" As always we said no.  Between the two of us we only need one or two rolls and getting the ayce is a waste of money.  Well the guy who we have never had before said that we will regret not getting the ayce and then laughed.  So we went on to get a salmon roll and japanese lasagna.  The salmon roll was delish (as always) the japanese lasagna on the other hand was hideous.... GROSS!!!  Then we ordered yellow fin tuna roll and that was also really good. \nThen here came the bill.... our bill was over $40!  we figured around $25.  The rolls are usually $4 the beers around $3.50 and the yukey japanese lasagna was close to $8.  Well after looking at the breakdown after the sticker shock!!!  They charged us for the sushi on the other side of the menu and not what we clearly pointed to on the menu.  The Hawaiian roll $9.95 and the $8 for the lasagna and Hamanchi Lover's Roll $10.50!  Making our total bill as much as the \"AYCE\" he was right we would regret not getting the ayce!  Ayce is $21.95 each but we only ordered and pointed to the rolls we wanted.  This was not our first rodeo here and we know what we order and have done so for OVER a year. The sushi chef knew what we pointed to and the waiter rang it up the way he wanted to.\nNEVER AGAIN even though we do love this place but buyer be aware!!!!  Make it VERY clear what you are ordering and double check!  \nSad for us but NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","useful":2,"funny":4,"cool":1}

My family makes it to Sasa on average twice a month because the food is so good, but last night there were so many minor issues that they added up to one lackluster visit.  First, it smelled bad as we walked in.  Then we ordered green tea and that even smelled stronger than usual that night.  We order 4 rolls and 3 appetizers but we finished all our rolls before we even got our appetizers because service was so slow and then when our first appetizer came, another foul smell of burning metal came from the kitchen with it.  The teriyaki beef, a go-to favorite, was old and dryer than usual.  Their new recipe fried calamari which was so delicious on our last visit was inedible this time.  The sushi rice was old and the wasabi was not its usual bright green color.  Again, I know Sasa so we will probably go back in two weeks despite this one bad experience but if we have this same low quality food next time, it will be our last visit.  It's just too expensive to have low quality food.  I have not seen the owners for a while so I wonder if it is under new ownership.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

One of the few AYCE sushi places I've seen here, and it's pretty great! \nTheir menu isn't as big as some other similar styled restaurants, however, we weren't disappointed with the majority of the food and service we received. \nMe and my boyfriend came in fairly late, around 10:30. On Friday and Saturday, they close at midnight, and last call is about 11:30. The waiter was very kind about letting us read over the menu (the entire menu is available for AYCE!) I'm a huge fan of eel, and many of their rolls feature this delicious fish. Among our meal, we tried mainly their specialty rolls, the Mardi Gras being my personal favorite. \nI must say though, I was extremely disappointed with the baked Volcano roll I had. The rice was mushy, and mayo tasted overly sweet, and the scallops were rubbery and overcooked. Maybe it was on off night, but it was very off-putting. \nThe waiter also brought us an oops roll. The chefs made a extra Screaming Orgasam, which was thoughtful to give to us, but we couldn't eat it! I'm horribly allergic to the green onions on the roll. So yay and boo :(\n\nOverall, this place is certainly worth stopping by! Make sure your group isn't too big. It's a small place!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Ok, so if he wasn't going to tell me the specials, I guess I had to get up to read them.. He finally offers the other menu.. Just seemed a little odd, but ok... Like, it was bothersome to get it...\nSo I ordered the Sasa 99, which was beautifully presented, but the sushi seemed warmer than what it should be.. It's sashimi and nigiri and a small roll of your choice of tuna, salmon and something else.. I ordered, and SAID, \"2 Pork Katsu DON\" pls.. The Katsu Don came with miso soup and salad, which I was totally impressed with and the bowl didnt have an egg.. I told the kids it's what I ordered though... \nSo I asked the waiter why their Katsu Don didn't have an egg, he said it did.. I said that's what I ordered then..he said no you didn't.. Uh yes, I did.. I said pork Katsu Don.. He said no- you said pork Katsu only. That's fine.. U can argue with me.. No problem.. \nSo, I went on to Yelp,  simply to see if I would get some sort of discount for checking in, and saw only the sake with an AYCE. My waiter, Tyler, approaches me again and says, \"I see you're posting a review on Yelp.. Even IF you ordered the Katsu Don, the kids already started eating the food so I would have to charge you extra.\" Charge me extra for EGGS?!? Ooohhh...

I've been to almost every single AYCE sushi place in Vegas and this place is hands down the best AYCE sushi place I've ever been to. The thing I love about this place is that they get our order correct every time. I can't stress how important this is because almost every other sushi place tries to skimp on their food. For example, if i get 2 sashimi salad, they'll use one fish portion and split it between 2 salads, or if I get 4 orders of shrimp tempura, they'll only give 4 or 6 pieces and not 8. But this doesn't happen at Sasa Sushi. They give the correct portion and correct amount every time. They also don't forget our orders like other sushi places frequently do.\n\nThe food is all excellent and tasty, the ama ebi (sweet shrimp) was sooo good and they use the biggest shrimps I've ever seen in a sushi restaurant. Everything was extremely fresh, the uni, salmon belly, and even the crab sticks were excellent. Service was excellent as well and our waters never fell below half the cup the whole time. The food wait time was extremely short even though the restaurant was packed.\n\nOne thing though is that their rolls selections aren't that good, and 90% of the rolls are shrimp tempura rolls with cream cheese. I didn't see any lobster rolls or soft shelled crabs rolls which was disappointing. So if you are into rolls then I wouldn't recommend this place, but if you are into nigiri with huge fish to small rice ratio, sashimi (yes they serve sashimi for AYCE!!), appetizers like oyster shooter, spoon specials (ask the server for this), and desserts (UNLIMITED MOCHI!!!), this is hands down the best sushi place you'll find in Vegas.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

No greeting at the door, actually no response period. Wasn't that busy, 4 people at the sushi bar, where we wanted to sit, but the empty seats hadn't been cleaned yet. Had to wait for that . Absolutely no friendly interaction from the bald sushi chef when we sat down, didn't even acknowledge us. Too busy with the two tables behind us and the obese couple sitting in front of him to bother with us. When we did get his attention, never once looked at us or asked if we wanted anything, so ordering was an ordeal. In the meantime the husband of the large couple at the sushi bar was talking loudly on his cell phone, so we had to listen listen to that for the next 14 minutes, still trying to get the  Sushi chefs attention .\nAfter only two hand rolls sloppily put together I was done. Have had better sushi at Smiths grocery store. Asked for check while listening to a kid screaming at the table behind us. Finally went up front, check was almost 60 dollars for maybe the thirty dollars worth of crap that was impossible to order. What a horrible experience. First time in twenty years I have ever not left a tip. The bald sushi chef was absolutely the most unfriendliness and unprofessional We have ever encountered. This was our first and last visit to this dump. Nice experience for Mother's Day?!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The tako was too chewy and the rice vinegar for the sushi rice was strong, so I didn't enjoy the flavor-texture combination.\n\nJapanese Lasagna: I thought there was too much cheese. It's difficult for me to figure out if there was too much cheese in the rolls or on top -- both, maybe? But being a cheese lover, even that was excessive.\n\nUnnamed Roll: The sushi chef created two pieces of sushi for us on the fly. The pieces had imitation crab on top of rice and were wrapped with a thin slice of tuna, which kind of reminded me of bacon. Not bad, we enjoyed it.\n\nSC 7 Roll: The roll is wrapped with soy paper and has drops of srirracha sauce on top. I thought I would like this roll, but the flavors didn't meld well. As much as I love srirracha, I thought it was what threw the flavors off-balance. \n\nTempura Ice Cream: Tempura battered vanilla ice cream served with chocolate syrup and a spray of whipped cream. Didn't care for the texture of the thick tempura shell. I also thought this was underwhelming when compared to the tempura ice cream that RA sushi has, which is the best one I've had so far in Las Vegas. \n\nSERVICE\nThe service here is terrific. Staff is friendly, competent, and attentive. \n\nOTHER\nSushi that isn't tightly rolled = contents will fall out. \n\nMaybe I'm just being picky, but one of the rolls ordered wasn't arranged neatly. I bring this up because I've before never seen sushi rolls presented sloppily. It reminds me of what my plate looks like when I hit up a sushi buffet and grab sushi pieces and plop them onto my plate. \n\nOVERALL\nMy rating for Sushi Sasa  is a 3.5\/5.0. The service is wonderful and the price for the AYCE lunch is awesome. The rolls are fine, but I wouldn't order the same items again.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":3}

She left to attend other tables. She never asked anyone to bring that drink. Some other guy, helped us for the rest of the night, he was slow but  not rude...so it was an improvement.

Here is why..\n\n1. We walked in asking for a table for 6 and the server immediately asked us \"Is this your first time here?\" We replied with \"Yes.\" You know, thinking she was going to be like \"Oh, welcome!! We're so happy to have you with us tonight!\" Instead, she responded with, \"Oh, next time, can you just make sure you call in to let us know that you have a big group coming in? As you can see we're quite small so it will just be better for both of us if you called in...\" Did I not just tell her that it was our first time? Was I supposed to know that you were a small restaurant? I thought this was like any typical restaurant that I can walk in with a party of 6 and you can accommodate us, even if it meant for us to wait a little? o_O? \n\n2. I checked in on Yelp and received a free sake, and what's some sake without some Asahi amirite? So we order a bottle of Asahi. Almost regrettable because it completely confused the crap out of the server and had her asking her coworker if that was allowed multiple times. Back and forth she went asking questions and thinking we were looking for a free bottle of Asahi with our sake when we repeatedly told her we just wanted to order a beer with our sake..! Just take my money already and give us the bottle of Asahi! \n\n3. The server continued to remind us she was new. The first time was a pass and understandable, but mistake after mistake after mistake and the excuse of being new does not fly with me. I give you the benefit of the doubt that you're a smart cookie, you don't have to keep telling me that you're new. I understood the first time. Just do better. And by better, I don't mean spilling water on our phones...which is exactly what she did -___-\" ohh laawwd. \n\n4. The upside and downside is that if you wanted any roll wrapped with cucumber you can do so, but only ONE roll when you're doing the AYCE option. Bummer because those are the only type of rolls I fancy. \n\n5. Obviously our server wasn't favorable but just in general I feel like the place is rather small where all servers are taking care of all tables. I personally like to have one attentive server when I dine because then you run into multiple servers asking you if you're doing okay in 5 minute rotations. But that wasn't the problem here, it just seemed like no one was being attentive. If possible, just dine at the sushi bar so you can get your orders in right away and not have to deal with that mess.\n\n6. Lastly, the reason why I'm like EEK! Methinks not! about Sasa is because I don't live in this area and don't see myself driving 20 minutes to visit here again. The food was OK but the service is really what left the bad taste in my mouth.","useful":6,"funny":4,"cool":6}

I was so excited about the new Sushi place and I think I will even give it one more chance. \n\nBoth times my order was incomplete so I had to keep asking for the same thing. It gets more irritating when they forget it again. It might be that they were very busy but this would never happen at Sushi Koma on the south side of Vegas or Sushi goyemon, probably one of the busiest AYCE sushi joint in town. \n\nThe biggest thing though, and this is serious, the fish quality has been very inconsistent. The scallop tastes very dried and the salmon is sometimes hard to digest. What offended me during one of my last twos visits was that the salmon came with whole bunch fish bones in it. This is unacceptable in a sushi restaurant. Also, the sushi rice kept on falling apart and the rice tasted very dried and blend. While I do not expect a 5 star sushi experience at a AYCE place, I do expect the basics are met. Having bones appear in your sushi is just embarrassing imo. \n\nI really love the people here and sasa was really good when i first tried it. I am willing to give it another chance and i hope things will get back to what they were used to be.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":1}

The place was busy but the guy next to me doing all you can eat was getting service. I deliberately waited for him to ask me whats next and he completely ignored me.

It was fresh, well prepared, and had a nice aesthetic. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is that I believe very small restaurants like this one shouldn't be taking reservations for small parties. \n\nNot only that, they weren't even sure which seats at the bar area were actually reserved or not. We were waiting for 35 mins for first available for two and once we sat down and got halfway through our meal, the hostess looked at the 4 bar seats next to us (that had been available since before we got there) and had to ask a chef if it was even really reserved or not. And it was extremely irritating to hear that they weren't even actually reserved for anyone! So we waited 35 mins to be seated for nothing. \n\nAll that aside, the food was great and I am definitely willing to come back and try again.

I've eaten at a lot of AYCE places in my day, so that says a lot.\n\nPros:\n\n1. The first and most important thing is the quality of the fish. With one exception where there was a bad batch of mackeral (which the chefs and I now have a running joke about now), I've never once been disappointed with the fish I've been served. Always fresh, always generously portioned, never over temperature or dry. Fish to rice ratio is also always right on point. \n\n2. The staff are great, especially the chefs. If you sit at the bar, they're always on point with getting you taken care of, and are a really fun bunch to have conversations with while you eat. Manny is a rock star. Seen the owner a handful of times and she's very nice.\n\n3. Their AYCE pricing is fairly standard, but the real deal comes from the AYCD bonus for only $5 extra. Even without it, the house sake is super cheap at $1.50 for a small and $3.00 for a large. Most place charge double or triple that. They also have a nice, fairly priced selection of cold and bottled sakes as well.\n\n4. The place is clean and doesn't smell funky. There's a lot of sushi places where you walk out smelling like an abandoned fish factory, but not here. Never had a dirty table. Bathrooms are well maintained. And, most importantly, to my knowledge they have never once had a health department grade lower than A. That's a huge deal in this town.\n\n5. They have shiso. This isn't something you'll commonly see in reviews, and most people don't even know what that is, but that's a big deal for me. Also known as perilla, its plant leaf that really enhances the flavors for certain nigiri items, especially squid and yellowtail. They even have a really rocking appetizer called Japanese Nachos that has deep fried shiso with a lovely fish mix on top of it. One of my favorite things there. \n\nMore often than not, if I ask for this at other places, they either don't have it, charge extra for it, or don't even know what it is (blasphemy!).\n\nCons:\n\n1. Generally the appetizers aren't bad, but aren't great either. Some things like the calamari and popcorn scallops are overcooked, small, and rubbery. They get the job done, but could be improved. Selection for them is also a bit limited. A minor complaint though, as I'm there primarily for the sushi, and the Japanese Nachos as stated above make me more than happy enough to not really care appetizer wise.\n\n2. Sometimes there will be a lot of reservations, so seating will be limited. Kind of a bummer when you're walking in on a Friday or Saturday night and there's a really long wait. Can't really knock them for it though, so this is more of just an FYI to call ahead on those nights to make sure there's seating available.\n\n3. Minor quibble, but there's no menu options for riceless rolls (i.e. the ones that use cucumber instead of rice).\n\nIn summary, I'm happy to be a frequent customer here and will continue to be one for as long as they're around.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Ive eaten enough sushi in my life to feed a small country and Sasa Sushi never dissapoints. So lets begin.\n\n-Food-: The sushi is top notch, fresh and there are plenty of rolls amongst other assortments on the menu to choose from. (Reccomended rolls- Tracy 2, Paradise, Alex's Munchie, Mikes Mardi Gras)\n\n-Service-: This is THE fastest most efficient sushi joint in town. I dont believe Ive had to wait more than 8 minutes (at the max) for a roll. I would highly reccomend sitting at the bar as the chefs (Manny, Kevin, and NIck) are nice, friendly, fun and energetic. The most important aspect in a restaraunt to me is engaging your client and this is exactly what they do.\n\n-Environment-: The restaraunt is a smaller yet efficient setting. As soon as you walk in, the bar will be right in front with booths to the left of it and normal seating tables to the right. The inside is clean with white and bright green tones along with other fixtures.\n\n-Prices-: The prices are comparable to other locations in town. I believe about $26 for AYCE dinner and $21 for AYCE lunch and add $10 for all you can drink. Individual rolls can run between $8-$12.\n\nOverall if youre not looking for a fancy sushi bar on the strip but want something more conveniant, while still getting great quality sushi, this is the place to be.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":3}

Restaurant is at the corner backend of a shopping plaza so curb appeal is not the best but we still proceeded inside. No one was in the restaurant so they said pick anywhere to sit. Sat down and we were immediately asked for what we wanted. No customer service whatsoever. We decided to just do a few rolls since we didn't know the place well and didn't want to do \"all you can eat\". Ordered and food came out very quick. I would recommend the Mexican roll, so good. I took a picture of it and the Cali Royale. Other then that nothing was great. The edamame was soggy and seemed like it was steamed a few too many times over and over again. The tiger roll, not on their menu but they can make it was so gross. The spicy tuna was mushy paste like, definitely did not have a good taste to it. \n\nI would come back only if we were stuck on this side of town like we were when we came here and only do those 2 rolls that I mentioned.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Walked in and greeted (or lack of) by this hostess who seemed to be rather peachy. Told us to seat wherever we pleased (in her very unwelcoming tone - someone must have pissed her off), brother gave me a sign to leave, I said we'll stay (well it was late and I had my kids and hungry all at once) and give it a chance so then comes the server, who was okay, he was a tad better than the hostess but still had an attitude (owners please treat y'all's employees better!!!). \n\nNow to sushi - it was subpar, (worst eel), don't remember anything above 3 out of 10 on any sushi and sides we had and we tried quite a bit.. Nothing stood out...\n\nService: (what service?) employees are just plain unhappy which makes customer unhappy (did I mention server came to bring food and still had food in his mouth? Hmmm guess we weren't the only hungry ones - keep it professional people, chew\/swallow it before coming out that curtain...

I went in by myself exhausted after a long day of working a trade show. I initially just wanted to have one roll, edamame and miso soup but as I started to look at the rolls it made more sense price wise to do AYCE.\n\nI sat at the bar and I'm glad I did. Nick, the sushi chef was amazingly pleasant! I told him I was a fan of ponzu sauce and I loved rolls with the jalapeño. He made a 2K roll, a tuna carpaccio, an amazing mint leaf dish and other things that he said were not on the menu that would he thought I would enjoy. The presentation of the dishes were also suprisingly nice. Nick even made things off soup spoons like they do at higher end restaurants! Nick truly made this experience a pleasant one!\n\nFor you die hard sushi eaters, this place is AYCE is all you can eat so do not expect the finest quality of fish but I can say that Nick made all the rolls and dishes superbly! \n\nParking was easy, service was great and it is well worth the money!

This time closer to home so we can hopefully reel in a location where we do not have to travel so far to. Sasa came up. \n\nHm.\n\nOK so we couldn't find parking. Although located inside a big plaza, Sasa is hidden in a small corner where parking was limited to about 4 maybe 5 vehicles, and 2 of them theirs. \n\nOk.\n\nWalked in and we were greeted, seated, and given our menus. If you follow me, you KNOW I KNOW, what I want. So we ordered right away.\n\nWhat ordered:\n\nAppetizers - \nShrimp tempura\nBaked green mussels 2 orders\nTofu agedashi \nCalimari\nPoke salad 2 orders\nCucumber salad\nSalmon kama\nMiso soup\n\nSushi -\nSweet shrimp with head\nBank\nBirthday\nUni\nMasago\nIkura\nTobiko\n\nChef special - \n5 piece salmon sashimi\nOyster shooters 2 orders\n\nSoooo,\n\nLet's start with the appetizers. Calimari had good flavor but had the texture of paper. Sorry Amanda G. In fact I felt that everything that was supposed to be served hot, calimari, agedashi, and mussels,  came out warm or nuked. \nThe poke. Oh the poke. They used a vinigerett sauce that made the fish not seem so fresh. I mean it was an OK mix, but poke is not suppose to be sour meh. The cucumber was not traditionally made. I mean maybe they were going for something different, but a mayo like sauce, nah, divorce the two, marry the mayo witthe poke, and the vinigerett on the cucumber salad and that may just be the match.\nSalmon kama came out great. In fact everything post appetizer came out fresh. Traumatized by the way the poke came out, we were pretty concerned about the well being of the rest of their food. I mean, uni is fresh sea urchin, so it has to taste right. To our surprise, their sushi was up there with some of the places we've been to. In fact the 5 slices of salmon sashimi that came out were 1\/4 to 1\/2 inch thick displayed on a banana leaf atop ice in a bowl.  Only 2 orders allowed btw for special dishes. The roes were not only attractive in color, but tasty as well. In fact, Sharo left surprisingly full by the end of the meal. \n\nSo why 3 stars Mikey?\n\nWe came in at the end of one servers shift, and the beginning of the other. And we all know how I rate. Customer service + food + overall experience = rating. Well, we did not get the best of service. Despite there being only 4 tables in total and 2 at the bar, we did not get the same overall treatment that we get in a restaurant that has 1 server to about 7 or 8 tables. I do not want to go in depth, but customer service can use some sprucing up.\n\nWill not be our first place to go if other sushi spots are open, but may be worth a second chance if we just need to pick up. \n\nDon't take my word for it, different strokes for different folks.","useful":8,"funny":2,"cool":3}

It was more up-scale looking than the old place, but I really only cared about the food.\nThe banner that showed the prices (in the old place) was gone, so I asked them how much the \"all you can eat was\". It was about $5 less than the old place.\nThis was about 3PM, and I saw a chef from the old place walk in to start work. Then I knew things would be okay with the food. \nThe ownership, host, waiters\/waitresses, and a few of the chefs had changed, but the waiter that was there that day was excellent and one of the new chefs was amazingly fast. He was the first chef that could make sushi rolls faster than I could eat them, which is good when you're doing \"all you can eat\".\nSo, better atmosphere, better host, better waiting staff, the same good chefs and food, and slightly cheaper prices. \nI would've have given it 5 stars before the switch, so definitely 5 stars now.\nOh year, I almost forgot...At 3PM a small saki is included in the price. I don't drink alcohol, so they gave me unlimited Iced-tea instead. So it's actually $7 or $8 dollars cheaper than it used to be when it was Sushi of Summerlin.\nNow, I just have to find a good Mexican restaurant, and I can die a happy man.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":1}

The health department needs to crack down here. I got AYCE and the first thing that arrived was the amaebi nigiri... I took one bite and was absolutely certain the shrimp was spoiled. I eat authentic Japanese food all the time, I grew up on it, so I know what amaebi is supposed to taste and look like. This was the worst shrimp I've ever had in my life; it was slimy, overwhelmingly fishy-tasting, and the outside was starting to disintegrate. What really concerned me is that when I told the waitress, she just wordlessly took it and tossed it out... No apology, no reaction, no concern... Which makes me suspicious that spoiled fish is a regular problem at Sasa Sushi. I ordered sushi rice for my daughter when she first took our order but all my food came out and 20-25 mins later I was still waiting on her food. The waitress also had a scowl on the whole time she served us. At first I was sympathetic because she and the only other server seemed overwhelmed but after a point it just became ridiculous, especially after I pointed out that their shrimp was rotting. Everything else was mediocre at best. I actually ordered so little that paying for AYCE was more expensive that if I'd done a la carte. I have no idea how this restaurant is still open... The service is horrible and the food ought to be illegal. I keep worrying whether I'll get food poisoning. I will never be back.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's far from bad, but it's not great in my book either.  Some notes :\n\nNigiri was hit and miss.  Some (like the sake) tasted fresh.  The Unagi was not cooked very much, so it was missing the slightly crispy edges I love.  The Ahi was SAD.  It was probably the pinkest colored ahi I've ever had, and the fish was FALLING APART.  They probably gave us the worst cut of the fish, one that most others would have THROWN out.\n\nThe Calamari was great though!  Light breading with salt\/pepper seasoning.  I think this was the highlight of the meal...we ordered a second round! \n\nHamachi Kama. Very good, flavorful collar! It's a very SMALL one though, but at least it's done well!  Yum :)\n\nSoft Shell Crab Hand Roll. Very good, and I love the presentation on their hand rolls!  Tasty :)\n\n\"Pain in the Ass\" was probably my favorite roll : Deep Fried Salmon, Tuna, Avocado and Cream Cheese. Heavy, but good overall, with a nice kick from the wasabi mayo.\n\nAnd to finish, I ordered the Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream. I didn't think it was bad, but Cathy really disliked it. Hit or miss? \n\nSo if you are in the area, give it a try!  But I'm not sure when I will be back...\n\nNot sure why the pics aren't linked below :","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I was feeling lazy so we went to an AYCE dinner in the northwest instead of driving further.  The sushi pieces were small given the amount of rice.  The nigiri\/sushi selection isn't as varied as places like Sushi Mon and Goyemon.  The sushi roll selection is similar to most places and my husband liked the rolls he ordered.  I was a little upset that they brought over a plate of tuna carpaccio and asked if we would like it.  I mean it's AYCE, if we wanted it, we would have ordered it!  Apparently the chef made it by mistake and was trying to offer it to different tables.  I saw them eventually take it to the back....since no one wanted it.  I also ordered yellowtail collar, although the outer cooked parts were good, most of the inside was raw and unedible...  They did have a sashimi option (1 order of one type of sashimi - about 5 pieces per person), which was a bonus that some other places do not offer.  Overall, I'd rather drive a little further down to Naka Sushi and pay a little less too!","useful":5,"funny":5,"cool":3}

Went there for lunch AYCE. Happy to discover a place close by my work. I consider myself a sushi-fanatic and I tried many of our fine sushi joints in town. For AYCE place, this is one of the best. What really stood out was the portion of the rice to the fish on the nigiris. The rice portion is tiny, compare to many other places. The nigiris were fresh and quite tasty. Tako was one of the best I've ever had. Superwhite and cajun albacore were probably my least favorite here. The chef prepared some off-the-menu, specials for us and they were DELICIOUS! He even made an Uni special, which was totally surprising. We were just doing the lunch AYCE, so uni isn't included usually but he pleasantly served us a yummy special! He also prepared a Tuna belly special, which was exceptional, as well as another one w sashimi wrapped in a leafy cone. Thx again Chef! Will return for sure!

We chatted a bit with our friends and then sat at the bar becuase we were only going to have a roll or two. Our friends, who were on a first name basis with the chef at that point, told the chef to take good care of us. The chef was very friendly and took our orders quickly and produced plate after plate of tasty nigiri selections with nice sized portions of fish and easy on the rice (I'm sure this was due to the influence of my friend). Either way, the sushi was good for a neighborhood sushi restaurant and we ate our fill. The only hiccup was when we went to pay, nobody was keeping track of what we ordered, they just \"assumed\" we were on the AYCE. So we ended up paying the AYCE price for 2 people for dinner when we were being careful not to over order so it wouldn't be too expensive. Not the biggest issue since we were close to that price anyway. I would recommend Sasa Sushi if you're in that neck of the woods, and just get the AYCE...it's easier in the long run.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Everything was delicious and so fulfilling as usual! You can ALWAYS customize your order to the way you want it here. So if you want more or less cream cheese on your baked green mussel, then they'll add it in.

I brought my appetite with me and had some time to kill so decided to write a detailed review. This is a LONG post, don't say I didn't warn you, lol. \n\nFirst of all, the people complaining about the staff\/service must have come in at peak hours (when it can apparently get real crazy). For lunch on a weekday though, no one else was there but me. So of course, I got great service. Just putting that out there so other diners know what to expect. Also, for those doing AYCE, order HALF ROLLS so you don't fill up too quickly as most of their rolls are 8 pieces. \n\nNow for the food. Their (Ahi and Salmon) Poke Salad was one of the best I've had. Nice and fresh INCLUDING the seaweed. Many times I've ordered this at other (more expensive) places and the quality was sub par. So I've been kinda wary ever since. But Sasa Sushi's Poke Salad has restored the faith. \n\nThe Miso Soup was just ok. There wasn't that much flavor but it wasn't too bland either. Safe to say I've had better. Next I had some Baked Green Mussel. This dish is a MUST TRY. I savored every bite! Their Shrimp Tempura was not that big but their Tempura Sauce is to die for! It's probably the best Tempura sauce I've ever tasted. Definitely recommend their Tempura selection if not for the sauce alone. \n\nNow for the rolls. I had two specialty rolls and one regular roll. First, the Spider Roll -- I've never seen it presented like this. They had it wrapped in yellow soy paper (as per the chef), and it was sweeter than most of the Spider Rolls I've had. Their soft shell crab didn't taste as natural (I guess) as what I've had before. Not to say that it wasn't fresh or tasty, it just didn't have that soft shell crab taste that I'm familiar with. \n\nThen I had the Volcano Roll -- which is baked, with scallops and sauce on top. Another must try! Their baked selection kind of has a distinct aftertaste that comes off as burnt foil I guess, but I only noticed that after I scarfed it down because it was just THAT good. \n\nAt this point I was getting filled up so for my last order, I got the classic -- Rainbow Roll. This was much bigger than I expected and tasted as awesome as I thought it would. I gotta say, their raw fish selection is nice and fresh. For dessert I had the Red Bean Ice Cream only because I'm starting to get tired of the Green Tea it's like everywhere I go there's green tea flavored something but I digress. I also had the Mango Mochi which aside from it not being firmly frozen, was amazing. I recommend it!\n\nThat's about it. Parking is available right out front and they have a TV at the bar. The bathrooms are nice and clean and the chefs are awesome and attentive. This place is definitely worth a try. Overall, I give them a 4\/5 star rating.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So the sushi Chef points us in the direction of a table and let's us sit. Then the server walked out, asked how many in our party, then walks away shaking his head at us.\nIn walks a single patron after us who sits at the bar and he immediately gets her a drink....still we have yet to be greeted. Then he decides to take a phone order and help another guest all before greeting us.\nI'd like to say that this is the first bad experience we've had at Sasa but since his arrival to the team it's been consistently terrible.

Upon reading the reviews with overwhelming positive reactions, I decided to eat here. The place wasn't busy at all and the servers were quick in response. Quality of fish was very poor. I always lower my expectations since I've tried sushi in Japan but this was considerably lower than that expectation. Nigiri was all I ate and the fish was definitely sub par. There were a few pieces that definitely had a sliver of fishiness to it. (Fish aren't supposed to taste \"fishy\" when fresh or handled correctly.) Although, the ratio between fish and rice was fine. I can't complain about price as it is average.\n\nI've had better in the Valley at the same price. This was close and convenient though so I'd thought I'd give this place a try.

The interior was beautifully decorated, everything was clean and modern from the tables and chairs to the light fixtures. We were seated promptly and our server could not have been nicer.\n\nSince we opted for the all you can eat option, we went to town and probably tried half the menu. We ordered all kinds of nigiri and sashimi including yellowtail, salmon, salmon belly, super white, and several types of tuna. We also got the fried tofu, a few orders of gyoza, yellowtail shoulder, and some miso of course. I rarely say this but I can honestly tell you that every single item we ordered was delicious! The fish was definitely fresh and of high quality, also the presentation was excellent. You can tell the chefs really love what they do because everything looked picture perfect. All the dishes appeared to be carefully pieced together and there were plenty of cool Japanese style garnishes that made for a nice presentation. My favorite items were the yellowtail sashimi and the \"Tracy II\" roll (if you like citrus and jalapeno flavors then it's an absolute must). Also the yellowtail shoulder was so delicious, it came out fully cooked but was remarkably flavorful and tender. We also ordered a bottle of cold sake which went unbelievably well with the food. I normally don't drink sake but the beverage menu was huge so we had to try something.\n\nAs for the service, everything came out fast and our server was really good about keeping our drinks topped off. The whole experience was just perfect, my girlfriend and I want to go back to this place as soon as possible. It's so rare to find food this good, especially for the price.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Automatically I started thinking that I don't know if I would want to eat at a place that eludes to anything that is gastrointestinal related.  However, my curiosity continued to get the best of me despite the name, so I checked out the website.  I was impressed with what I saw.  I'm a crazy picky eater so there are some dishes on the menu that you couldn't pay me to try, but there were also several that excited my stomach.  I'm a music junkie so I became even more excited when I read that different local DJs hit the ones and twos every night!  I said to myself, \"Self, we are so going to Soul Gastrolounge!\"  \n\nOne of my friends and I met up there on a Friday night around 9:00 and the place was packed!  There's a really cool outdoor patio that overlooks the street and inside is dimly lit and full of a laid-back, eccentric vide.  I thought to myself, \"I've found where I belong (tear, sniffle, sniffle).\"  My friend and I were told that we would have an hour and 15 minute wait, which normally would've sent us packing but we were fully committed.  So, we chose to wait at Twenty-Two (check out my review) which is right below S.G.\n\nWhen it was time for us to be seated we were lead to a bar right by the DJ booth (who was awesome btw).  Our server came by in a matter of seconds to take our drink orders and then we perused the menu.  Since I had already looked at it online I decided to order the Soul Wings (I wasn't feeling as adventurous that night but trust me I'll going back to try oh so much more.) and the french fries with garlic-herb salt, pecorino & truffle oil.  The wings were okay but I loved the fries.  Our server came back to check on us several times throughout our stay and was pretty darn amazing.  \n\nI'll definitely be back here.

They have creative and unique menu items, tapas (small plates for you Anglophones), interesting cocktails and the best bartenders in town. Getting up to the bar is like a game for me and I love it. How many people can I squeeze by to get into the prime seating?\n\nThe vibe at Soul is upscale, most nights there is a DJ, it's dark and a little loud, but somehow still pulls itself off as a speakeasy-like atmosphere. Definitely come here with a small group. Big groups will never get seated -- just not enough space. Sharing tapas is the best way to go here. I have never eaten a meal here without sharing their fries, a generous portion of garlicky, perfectly delicious fries. Shoe string style if you were wondering. I, also, highly recommend their sushi. The Soul roll is one of my faves, not overly spicy, so don't let those jalapeños scare you off. \n\nIf you want interesting cocktails you have come to the right place. Check out their menu with tons of house favorites (Basil Smash) or tell Adam or one of the other awesome bartenders what you like and they will mix up something special just for you. \n\nOn most nights and ALL weekends you will wait at Soul, for sometimes up to an hour, but it is totally worth it. Elbow in at the bar and order some cocktails and hummus to keep you happy while you wait. If you can snag a place on the patio on a night with good weather, you have definitely hit the jackpot. Perfect view of the Charlotte skyline. Soul is a great date spot -- nothing like getting to know someone by sharing food. \n\nSoul has always been an ultra hip spot in the sea of a semi-hip place, but now that Plaza Midwood is growing up, I think Soul compliments its neighbors well (ie: Peculiar Rabbit and Twenty Two). If you have someone you want to impress in Charlotte, go ahead and head over to Soul Gastrolounge.","useful":5,"funny":4,"cool":4}

I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  It has a trendy, young vibe.  Good music, alternative looking waitstaff, clean, yet interesting decor with the exposed ceiling beams and red brick walls.\n\nWe started with an x-rated martini and the drink special of the night, the cucumber-mint mojito.  While the martini was a bit over-priced ($11) and not that tasty in my opinion, I really enjoyed the mojito.  Typically mojitos are quantity over quality (aka low liquor content), but not this one.  There was a good balance of all of the flavors.\n\nWe picked from a wide array of items from the menu, from dips to small plates.  My favorite item was the asia pork-belly tacos with watermelon salsa.  Though this sounds like a strange combination of ingredients, it worked perfectly!  I love when dishes have contrasting tastes and textures that work together in harmony, and this hit the mark on both counts.  The garlic and truffle oil fries were really good as well, though I always love me a little extra truffle oil, which this lacked.\n\nOur waiter, Justin, was awesome, he managed to always be there when we needed him for ordering another drink to bringing extra condiments, but he was not obnoxiously ever-present.\n\nI will definitely go here again!

My next time around, it was better... but then again I went on a Wednesday night  with one friend at 9pm (still crowded but wait was 5min). \n\nIn sum, my 5 star rating is for the food quality and the ambiance once you are seated.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The first time I went I was stuffed but friends ordered the veal shortribs, Korean BBQ wings and pork buns.  \n\nShort ribs- Not as tender as I would have liked.  The whole point of braising is to get the meat to a point where its fork tender.  This was not the case and it distracted from the overall flavor.  \n\nKorean BBQ wings- the outside skin was nice and crunchy but the inside meat was bland and not seasoned.  So anticlimactic.\n\nPork buns- They were ooook.  The meat to bun ratio could have been kicked up a bit but the flavor was to be expected.\n\nNow, the second time I visited Soul was a hot mess.  I arrived at 7:30 to find that there were no tables available.  I understand that this is commonplace most nights.  I ordered a crunch roll at the bar- I thought this was yellowtail and some tempura flakes or something.  An HOUR later my sushi was done.  Admittedly, it did get pretty crowded in there but come ON.  You dont even have to cook it!  When I asked the bartender where my sushi was his only response was, \"it's coming.\". Well, it came but I don't think it was a crunch roll at all, it was the tempura shrimp roll.  But I ate it anyway, I was starving by that point.   It was also very tasty-which I hate to admit.\n\nSo that said, if I go back to Soul Gastrolounge, I will be a) only ordering sushi and b) watching my waiter\/waitress\/sushi chefs like a hawk so they don't play games with my food.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

It is great to come here with friends,yet intimate enough for a date. It is one of the few places you can come alone and blend with the scene. It gets packed on the weekends so be ready for a wait, but it is fun to people watch in the meantime. My tip is to come earlier in the week because there are great djs every night.

Seriously, I could eat about a dozen of 'em.  \n- Ramen - oddly creamy, bland, largely unmemorable but the cheeks were cooked well.

Greasy but very flavorful. \n- Crunch Roll  - didn't realize the whole roll was fried, accordingly the fish was cooked through.  Sad face, don't recommend. \n- Wings.  Both Korean BBQ and Southern - nothing fancy, but good.\n- Fries - garlic-herb salt, truffle oil, pecorino, yes!

We started with the cheese plate, and white bean and goat cheese dip, both were very good. We were then bombarded with everything else we ordered, this always irritates me at tapas restaurants because the whole point is to eat slowly, trying and enjoying each new plate. IF your gonna bring it out all at once don't put tapas as your main menu, put app and entree. It was so bad we literally had no room for the last plate on our table. Other than that the tapas was very good. Here are our highlights: the mushroom and egg toast was amazing, curried lamb skewer was also very good, it came with a mango chutney, the fried oysters were also very fresh. I wouldn't recommend the braised veal shank as it was very fatty, the dolmades were just OK, but the hummus that was served as a side was out of this world.

Okay enough about how much I actually love this place bc this is ::dun dun dunnnnnhhhh...:: is a negative post bc i had an absolutely terrible **** of a server. I made him wait (my relatively blind date) and we made our server follow us as we moved down 3 whole tables to the corner table to have a little privacy earlier this evening... we must have asked far too much of her. I KNOOOOOOOOW that everyone has a bad day every once in a while and I say this with the deepest concern bc I too have been a server for many years... almost a decade to be exact (although I don't look it) NONE THEE LESS... I don't know her name... this relatively wretched looking, worn down, mousey brunette server with her muffin-top and complete disregard for her looks in general, not matching, no makeup, hair w obviously no effort and potentially unkempt for quite sometime with the rest of her looks... had less then charm, patience, concern or general care of us (i was on a FIRST date  mind you) as patrons. I am being potentially bias and a touch harsh do to upset but honestly she was quite the sight for sore eyes in the joint and I wouldn't give her a gold star for server of the month, I expected more bc everything is normally perfection. The general purpose of the story IS that she was a mediocre and not so visually or otherwise satisfying server...NOT saying she deserved or should have gotten a 10% tip... but she did. In my defense I was on a FIRST DATE!!! We left not keeping her tooo late, I mean the dance music was still bumping and we went to Thomas Street to have a night cap (we did see her there after her shift I'm presuming) then on the walk back to my car as we cross-walked in front of our server in whatever POS she is still struggling to pay off  and she yells from her window \"THANKS FOR THE 10% TIP\"  then peals off and hauls ass. Before her rude display of disdain from an unsavory tip (honey it happens to the best of us) I hadn't a clue... my date was embarrassed (which he should have been, 10% is never acceptable but NOT that she deserved much more...she wasn't an impeccable server by ANY means) I was without words and it was just a sh!t end to an otherwise decent evening. All I'm saying is loud mouth b!tches that don't know when it is appropriate to say something and when it isn't is the ONLY problem if any bc SOUL is an amazing place and the completely uncouth lady (i say that lightly) that served my table didn't deserve the tip she got. I understand a bad night but we weren't even a rude table and sometimes instead of acting like an a-hole you just gotta chock it up to the game, I say it only from experience... cut the fat from the sassy server staff and I would have NO complaint. BASICALLY I wanted to say B!TCH bc I didn't get to before she sped off. Get a filter... Serving is an acting job and you diffidently didn't look or act the part... step it up or find a new profession bc you suck.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I will say, if you don't like tattoos and piercings on your waitstaff, probably not the place for you. Me? I don't care. The house mixologist is excellent. His take on a moscow mule is the best I've ever had. Its so good that they keep it on draft! Its one of three restaurants in Charlotte to which I consistently return. \n\nSide note: the sushi is amazing.\n\nFinally, be forewarned: If you go on the weekend you WILL wait two hours to be seated. Its worth it.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

As the other Yelp reviewers confirmed, there was at least an hour and a half wait - but they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, which is super convenient if you want to bar hop in the area while you wait. \n\n We only ended up waiting an hour and were seated. We ended up ordering the pork belly tacos, truffle fries, Korean BBQ wings, avocado stack salad, and a sushi roll. Each portion is small and comes out when it is ready. \n\nThe pork belly tacos were everything that the previous reviews said they were gonna be - AMAZING. The watermelon added a nice tang to the saltiness of the pork. \n\nThe truffle fries were amazing as well. Hot and crispy and seasoned to perfection as any good fry should be. \n\nThe avocado stack salad was literally amazing and life changing and everything a avocado loving person like myself would dream of. \n\nThe Korean BBQ wings were ok. I'm a fan of spicy food, but this seemed like someone just poured a whole bottle of hot sauce into a bowl, added a dash of Korean seasonings and tossed the wings in there. Wouldn't order again. \n\nThe sushi roll was good. I believe it was called the Geisha roll. Could be wrong. \n\nDefinitely would come back here, but probably during a weekday when it might not be so busy, in comparison to a Friday or Saturday.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I love the exposed brick, low lighting and relaxed seating. It does get a bit noisy around the bar, so if you are looking for something more private get a booth. We were able to grab one of the couches and people watch while enjoying the food. One down side is they do not take reservations so get there early. Luckily, I knew this and we showed up around 6:30 and were one of the last to be seated right away and ended up staying until around 9. This is a tapas bar so you never really know how long people will stay.\n\nNow...onto the food... Which was amazing! The tuna tacos were great, I would have liked them in a soft taco instead of a hard shell, but that is just personal preference. I found myself with sauce all over my fingers after one bite. The white bean and goat cheese dip was just ok, I tasted more bean than cheese though. We had an amazing flatbread that was on special that evening which was the highlight for me. New potatoes, corn, cheese and pesto... Mmmmm! Something I have learned is ALWAYS ASK FOR THE SPECIALS! \n\nThe drink prices were right on target and not overpriced. The service was on point before our server was sat several times with one table being a party of 12. Tatyana still checked on us often and kept our water glasses filled. \n\nMinus one star for not being able to make reservations or call ahead seating. We do not live close to the city, so showing up and not being able to get in when we want would be disappointing.\n\nOverall a great experience. We will be going back!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Don't expect to just walk in and get a seat - it's not uncommon for the wait to be hourS (yes, plural)! Pro tip though, download the NoWait app and get a place in line without having to physically walk in. Then just head up about 15 minutes before the expected seating time to get a drink. Be sure to keep your phone closeby because sometimes you're up earlier than expected and you only have 10 minutes to claim your table. Cocktails are good, but don't expect a hefty pour.

Unless you like having someone brush up against you. Whatever works, son.\n\nThe food itself is the attraction for me. Soul Gastrolounge takes its culinary cue from the classic tapas bar set-up; you're hungry, but you don't want a big meal, you want something you and your party can pick on and share together. There's definitely much on the menu in terms of appetizers and tapas to choose from. The sushi is also quite spectacular, surprising for a non-sushi restaurant.\n\nI particularly enjoy eating and drinking on the balcony. At night, you're blessed with an uncluttered view of uptown Charlotte. The balcony's a bit crowded, since it's quite narrow, but the view's pretty nice, plus, if you're lucky, you'll get to see the freight train come across the heart of Central Avenue.\n\nHonestly, I'd eat at Soul Gastrolounge any time, even when we're not feeling lounge-y. This is one of my favorite places to eat in town.","useful":6,"funny":2,"cool":3}

If the pricing was a little better, I might be able to attend more but can't fit it in my budget as frequently as I'd like.\n\nI recently took my cousin and her fiancé as they were visiting from Poland and they both enjoyed their experience (probably him more than her).\n\nWe each started with a drink, my cousin and I got the Rosé, and he got a scotch on the rocks. The waiter mixed up orders and brought two scotch on the rocks but that wasn't a hard fix :). They offer cucumber water so if you want plain, be sure to let your waiter\/waitress know. It's very refreshing and light, and I enjoy that little difference they offer. Who isn't bored of regular water with a lemon anyways??\n\nIt's a tapas style restaurant so we shared the stuffed piquillo peppers, garlic fries, tuna tacos, and bone marrow. I haven't had a bad experience with Soul's food and that's a reason I keep coming back. \nThe last couple times I've been a bit disappointed that my bone marrow bone was very small and in turn, yielded very little bone marrow to enjoy. Luckily this time I had a nice, deep bone and all three of us were able to enjoy it. The texture is a little slimy and bulky, sometimes salty but it melts in your mouth...don't forget to add it on top the provided grilled bread, so delicious.\nTuna tacos never fail either. They're marinated, diced tuna in fried wonton tacos (thin and light), with marinated cucumbers and sriracha mayo (not spicy). \nThe fries are garlic-herb salted, dusted with pecorino & truffle oil are always necessary to get. They are thin (almost McDonalds looking), and not greasy so you don't feel too bad eating them. Trust me, try them if you haven't.\nThe herb cheese stuffed piquillo peppers on bruschetta are sooo good. The cheese is light, not heavy feeling and compliments being stuff inside the pepper. They come out warm on the bruschetta so I'd recommend eating them when they arrive. No worries if it cools a little because they're still delicious.\nMy cousin and her fiancé had a lamb gyro and enjoyed it. It was a reasonable size as they were able to split it between them.\n\nOverall this experience went well. It was later at night when we arrived so there wasn't a wait (about 10pm), but if you're looking to go closer to the weekend you could be waiting for hours. Prior to this visit I utilized the \"no wait\" app and I'd suggest doing the same as well because once everyone gets out of work, or its dinner time on the weekend, the place will fill up real quick. Very quickly. I mentioned living close by so the \"no wait\" app works perfectly. (No joke) about 1.5-2.5 hrs before I know we want to go to dinner, I put our name on he list and just wait. An hour prior to their guesstimated time I will start getting ready and once we're the next to be seated we start walking over. I once put our name on the no wait app a little late (630-7pm?) and were given such a late time that we opted to go somewhere else. We forgot to take our name off the list and we're finally messaged around 1130 that a table was ready. We've already eaten elsewhere and made it uptown by that point so no need to make it over. Needless to say, do some research and utilize the no wait app if Soul is still affiliated with it. Otherwise you may not get to eat at a reasonable hour unless you score a seat at the bar which is first come first serve. Or, you may like the Parisian eating schedule, and all I'd have to say is \"enjoy\" :). \n\nGreat place, amazing and different food, great vibe with upbeat music... try to make a stop in if you're in from out of town. Your guests shouldn't be disappointed... unless they like the normal burger and fries or shrimp scampi and don't like trying new things.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This place is popular - people know about their daily drink specials, their eclectic menu, and friendly service, full of suggestions and refills... and being that I wait tables myself, I am hardpressed not to leave the moment I've finished my meal and the place starts filling up. I'd LIKE to sit and stay for several more drinks but my inner-server tugs on my sleeve, telling me to get goin' and let the people make their money (not THEIR servers, though.) \n\nWhere do I start? Went with my boyfriend and roommate one Monday, arrived fairly early, around 6pm, and the server told us about the specials and I ended up grabbing their flatbread special after I heard the words \"crab\" and \"arugula.\" I LOVED THIS DISH. The crab\/arugula\/lemon vinaigrette\/candied garlic combo is genius, I could eat it out of a tub. It would be just as good as a salad, with more arugula, of course. \n\nMy roommate, who isn't altogether very picky or adventurous, ordered the sliders and cleaned his plate. My boyfriend and I shared the hamachi and jalapeno, which is super fresh, has a pretty presentation, and the accompanying sauce is right on point for the fish. \n\nI drank their sparkling sake, sparking rose, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, the boys had Newcastles, and we were satisfied overall with their selection. I might have ordered beer if their selection was better. I could use some more microbrews, seasonal stuff, etc. The sake is ok, the rose is good, and the Sauvignon Blanc was good. Nothing to write home about. I sampled the new Greek wine they hadn't put on the menu after ordering an Assyrtiko blend that was on the menu, but it wasn't for me, and the server graciously agreed that she may not have wanted an entire glass of it, either. Makes you more comfortable when a server agrees with your dislike of something, so I appreciated it. \n\nI love the warm ambiance, the coziness, and though I've only been there once, I could tell that many others love this place, too. It's moderately priced (well, pretty cheap, actually, if you're used to eating out fairly regularly,) and the three of us spent $80 (tip not included) on snacks and bunches of drinks, including a couple glasses of wine and a small-ish bottle of sake ($12.)  \n\nDefinitely close to 5 stars for what it is -- a cool little gastropub.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":3}

Armed with a Corporate card and a coworker, we arrived at Soul on a Wednesday evening and hardly had to wait.  We both got a table outside, which was actually really nice on an early fall evening.\n\nService was great - our server was very nice and our plates were cleared quickly and waters always full.  \n\nFor food, we ordered the following:\n\nAsian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos - ain't nothin' \"Asian-glazed\" about these tacos... unless something like five spice qualifies as \"Asian\".  However, these were my favorite out of the bunch we ordered.  The pork belly was nicely cooked, really flavorful with the \"Asian Glaze\" and the watermelon salsa (really just marinated watermelon) added a nice flavor to the bite as a whole.  I would probably rather have this without the tortilla.\n\nRamen bowl - very large serving!  The first 5 bites of this was really good, but then it just really became way too salty.  The ramen noodles were nice and chewy and reminded me of the kind that comes in American instant ramen (Top Ramen).  What really stood out here were the veal cheeks that basically melted in your mouth and the amazing goat cheese fried mushrooms.  YUM.\n\nBone marrow - pass.  This hardly tasted like anything and was basically a ton of butter on some crostini.\n\nFlatbread - truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic and fresh arugula - actually quite tasty, but hard to eat.  It was very soggy, but had really good flavor from the mix of ingredients.\n\nKorean BBQ wings - I live in NYC... where Korean chicken wings are a real thing and really delicious.... unfortunately these do not compare.  Chicken wings need to be more crispy, in my opinion.\n\nFor dessert, we got the banana chocolate phyllo turnovers - such a good decision and at $5, it was very reasonably priced.  However the star of this show was the banana pudding ice cream - SO GOOD.  Too bad they don't sell it by itself.\n\nI'm not really sure what to call this place... like an American\/Asian \"fusion\" or what, but it's a decent place for drinks and tapas with a good environment.

I loved the salmon o pita, saganaki (fried cheese), piquillo pepper bruschetta, and garlic french fries. The curried lamb skewers had awesome flavor, but were a tad bit dry. The marinated mushrooms weren't that memorable.\n\nOur service was great. I tend to watch the wait\/bar staff when I eat out, and I noticed they really get along and help each other out at Soul.

In the world. First the Hip eclectic ambiance is perfect for date night or just a night cap with drink . The Dj is always on point and will have you grooving in your seat. The staff is always friendly and service is always great. I would recommend calling before hand seeing that this place is very popular and the wait can get a little lengthy depending on what time and what day of the week you go. They specialize in tapas, or small plates, which is why this place is perfect for someone who enjoys many flavors and wants to try many different things in one sitting. Each dish comes out as it is ready which is nice so you don't have to worry about everything coming out on top of each other.  I have had every thing on the menu with the exception of maybe one or two things but trust me I am getting around to it. Of course I have my favorites. The pork belly tacos are a must! Everything about them is why you should try them and I'm sure everyone who has had them will agree their truffle fries are amazing along with the fried brussels sprouts which give you a perfect balance of sweet and savory. I have had the curried lamb skewers, and the chimichurri beef which are both amaze-balls and you cant go wrong with either! The veal short ribs are to die for and you shouldn't hesitate on ordering that Ramen bowl! I can always go for those sashimi tuna tacos, the cucumber and sriracha mayo together in one bite is heaven! I always end my meal with one of those grilled caesar salads and I never regret it! They have an awesome sushi selection and the drink list is one of a kind!

This spot is phenomenal and absolutely worth it. First off I'd like to mention you should use the yelp waitlist feature because this small location will get a long wait of easily an hour to three.  The chefs and owners of this restaurant clearly took time to create amazing flavor fusions in their food that you won't likely find elsewhere. Highly recommend the pork belly tacos, as well as the ramen. The ramen was different from any ramen I've ever had before and really had a unique twist with great bold flavors. We also tried a couple sushi rolls, both were amazing but my particular favorite was the special of the day, and also the lamb lollipops were absolutely worth the price. Judging on the tasting I had with a sprinkle of things across the menu I can only assume everything they have to offer is amazing. That being said if you go with a group I'd recommend ordering a lot and sharing with the table so you can try a bit of all the unique flavors!

Let me start by saying they have been extremely consistent since 2013 which is rare and very important at the same time. \nConsistent in many POSITIVE aspects:\n1. The customer service from hostess to bartenders to servers at the table.\n2. The food is consistently GOOD & we've eaten all over the menu from front to back. From Tapas to full plates to sushi to sides.\n3. The drinks  are very consistent in flavor and alcohol levels to ice\nThe one NEGATIVE consistency:\n1. THE WAIT & not accepting reservations\n\nThe plus to the only negative consistency I have is that they offer table places using the NoWait app which is new and a HUGE plus. Lastnight my husband and I were at a concert and was able to put our name down in line while enjoying the last two acts because it specified that we had 89 - 110 minutes before our table would be ready and showed us that there were 24 parties before us.\n\nLet's Get down to the goodies. The food is not complex it's straight forward and GOOD. Some of our go to's are:\nSashimi tacos \nFried oysters \nGarlic shrimp skewers \nLamb lollipops \nBeef skewer \nA number of sushi rolls which we tried the Godzilla lastnight and wasn't a huge fan due to the cream cheese. I asked if they could only put 1% on and was told YES however they put 101%. It was too creamy and we ended up picking out the cream cheese per piece before eating. \nOur server was super cool and he noticed all the cream cheese on our plates and once we ordered dessert Chocolate Bread pudding (which was amazing) he brought it out and informed us that he was comping it due to the mix up with the cream cheese which we Super cool as we didn't complain we just took the cream cheese out and ate the roll.\nThis place is the perfect DateNight spot with the dim lighting and cool music. It's also a cool spot to catch up with friends and enjoy some drinks and small plates. \nIf you are going for the first time please note that it's not accessible friendly as you have to climb the black fire escape black cast iron stairs to enter.

We were impressed by our initial entrance.  The restaurant\/bar is situated on the 2nd floor of an old restored brick building.  The outdoor seating offered fantastic views of the Charlotte Uptown skyline.  Inside there are a few booths (with high backs), a few tables, a bar, a DJ booth with stools, and some sofas and chairs.  All in all, it offered a great, casual, fun atmosphere.  The place was \"hopping,\" but luckily, we were seated right away at some empty stools indoors around the DJ booth (who wasn't there at the time).  \n\nThe menu offers a variety of tapas.  We had a hard time picking out which ones we would order, but finally were able to narrow it down to five to share.  We chose the (1) Sashimi Tuna Tacos, (2) Lamb Lollipops, (3) Bone Marrow, (4) Boursin Cheese Stuffed Piquillo Peppers on Bruschetta, and (5) the Sushi Crunch Roll.   The tuna tacos were very flavorful and were like very mini tacos.  The lamb was good and tender, but I probably wouldn't order them again because I'd rather try some of their other (cheaper) skewers of meat.  We were adventurous with the bone marrow, but it was our least favorite and something we wouldn't order again.  It was a little too gel-like for my taste, although one of them tasted like egg (?).  The bruschetta was creamy and rich with flavor.  I'd definitely order that again.  The sushi crunch roll was huge!  It was very wide, so we had to cut it in half before eating it.  I liked it, but I've had better crunch rolls, so I'd try a different kind of sushi roll next time.  \n\nOur server was fantastic.  She was very friendly and, being that it was our first time, she explained a little bit about the menu.  Even though she had several other tables, she kept checking on us after each tapas was brought out.  \n\nAll in all, we had a fantastic time and it's a great place to hang out for a date night, with friends, or to bring out-of-town guests who like a vibrant scene.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":3}

Show up when they open (5pm) or be prepared for a long wait. We've waited 30 minutes on a Friday night before. \n\nMade the mistake of going on a Saturday night around 7pm and they told us the wait was going to be 2-2.5 hours. That's insane. We tried to wait for a seat at the bar, but it was too packed and you'd practically have to get in a fist fight with other couples waiting for the same thing. We ended up placing our order to go- the bartender was super nice about this, gave us water with cucumber slices while we waited, and was very friendly. The menu is small plates, and I have always been with my husband and we order anywhere from 3-5 to share. \n\nSince this review is skewing negative, let me get to the positive. ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS WITH WATERMELON SALSA!!!!! This is all you need to order. In fact, this may be all you need to eat again for the rest of your life. This menu item should be trademarked. As we were eating them, eyes closed in ecstasy, I wondered who the chef was behind these tacos. They cannot possibly be paying him or her enough. These tacos are seemingly simple. They are small flour tortillas topped with exactly 3 cubes of the Asian glazed pork belly and 3 cubes of watermelon \"salsa\", which is really just watermelon in some sort of vinegary marinade. I am seriously not doing these justice right now. I don't even love pork all that much, but I will always order these- they are life-changing. For frame of reference, That time we got the to-go order we ordered 4 orders of the pork belly tacos, 2 for each of us. Didn't give the rest of the menu a second glance.\n\nWe have eaten at Soul a handful of times now, tried various other things on the menu. We tried the sushi, it's fine. We tried the bone marrow, for fun, and that was cool and tasty. But we always come back to those tacos. They might be my death-row last meal sort of choice. The combination of sweet, salty, sour, crunchy....I am drooling just thinking about these, days later. \n\nOh, the cocktails are also good. :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Soul is an Uptown restaurant that somehow got lost down Central Ave. Trapped on the wrong side of the tracks. It isn't comfortable here.\n\nThe food was nice enough. I was surprised at how much of the menu didn't appeal to me, but that's probably a function of them being adventurous cooks and me being a picky patron. Regardless, I found somethings I wanted, and when the food arrived (green onion hummus, salmon-o-pita, and mini-burgers) it was delicious. Not paradigm changing, but definitely worthwhile.\n\nYet the meal's experience was lacking. It had the loud, rowdy atmosphere of Plaza Midwood, but also the snobbery of aging Uptown frat boys. That is a weird combination. I like the Plaza Midwood energy. I can handle frats. But they don't work well together.\n\nAnd vis-à-vis music, I prefer Twenty One downstairs.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":0}

Ramen was legit great the broth is superb. Sushi was good but not amazing in our opinion, wish we would've ordered the stuffed shells that a table next to us got, they raved and it looked awesome.

For not having that many tables and being permitted to sit for 4 hours, if you so choose, the place gets a bit cluttered and you end up waiting a long time. \n\nI guess when people agree to wait for three hours to eat there, they dont really care but the amount of extra business they could be doing is unfortunate. \n\nBut if I leave you with anything...its get the pork belly tacos!!","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":2}

My girlfriend and I had a weekend visit from one of our other friends who is super into food, so we saw this as the perfect chance to give it a shot.\n\nThey don't take reservations at Soul G so we went later on a Friday night (around 9:30 PM) expecting it to be a little crowded. We ended up having to wait around 10-15 minutes to be seated so we were all good there.\n\nWhile waiting, we each ordered a cocktail. The only things I remember about the cocktail was that it was mezcal-based (because I love it), and that it was room temperature. It was NOT good. Not a great start.\n\nOnce we were seated, that's when it really went downhill for us. We were seated in the back corner right next to the DJ and right underneath a speaker blaring music. The music was BUMPING and not in a good way. It was crazy loud and way too much volume for a dinner. I get it was Friday night around 9:30 but we were screaming at each other from across the table. Not fun. I'm not sure exactly what vibe they were going for here. We did ask the server if it was possible to get the music turned down a tad but I'm not sure he ever got to it.\n\nLUCKILY, the food we ordered was actually pretty good and we were able to scream approval to one another after most of the dishes.\n\nAsian Glazed pork belly tacos - 4\/5 - You might see pictures of this all over the place and rightfully so. That's not a combo I'd really think of but the pork is juicy AF and the watermelon goes great with it. I'm not a huge fan of watermelon in the first place but it worked.\n\nPan Con Tomate - 5\/5 - THIS was just awesome. A little bit different take on pan con tomate with spanish chorizo, a rioja reduction, and whipped manchego. As a huge manchego fan, this was a really fun one for me.\n\nBone Marrow - 4\/5 - Love me some bone marrow. Tons of flavor but didn't really have all that much to go with the toasts. Tough to split between 3 people.\n\nSpanakopita - 3\/5 - Eh. It was alright. Served fresh which helped its cause, but I'd say if you aren't craving it, go with something else.\n\nQueen Charlotte Roll - 5\/5 - YES. tempura shrimp, cucumber, capelin roe. Big time score.\n\nFries - 4\/5 - Came with garlic-herb salt, pecorino, and truffle. Some places overdo it on the truffle when it comes to fries but these were pretty good and served fresh.\n\nAll in all, the food was good here but the rest of the experience was just kinda disappointing. If I come back, I'll do so earlier or on a different night and I suggest if you want to enjoy some conversation that you do the same.","useful":6,"funny":2,"cool":2}

Like - extremely.\n\nDriving up, I was mortified to see that Soul was \"that sketchy place I pointed out last time we went to Dish.\" It's in a building where the downstairs tenant is gone and has been replaced by brown paper window coverings. The building next door has chains on the windows. So it doesn't scream - this is a good idea!\n\nHOWEVER! Once you step into Soul, it's a different world. Very cool decor and trendy crowd.

Since then, I have avoided what the bartender \"recommends\" and go with what I'm feeling.. so far, much better.\n\nThe food is not hit or miss. It's very hit. The lamp lollipops are very memorable.

Three were told 45-hour wait, and then waited an hour and a half to be seated while they continued to seat parties of two and six at 3\/4 person tables who came in. I know things get hectic, I know sometimes there are reservations we're not aware of, however ANY other establishment would not have let one party wait for 1 1\/2 hours (especially 30+ mins over their estimate), while that happened.\n\nWe finally got seated and my sister asked to see the manager and way too nicely explained the situation was a bit frustrating. The manager looked at her blankly and goes \"uh well sometimes there are things you don't know about....i guess i can get you a glass of wine? Try to enjoy you meal though\".\n\nCompletely offensive and unprofessional, however what made it so much worse is\nthat even though he was the one delivering our food, he didn't come back once to check to make sure we were okay. And not that we were trying to get free food, but didnt take a single plate off (btw we spent well over $200 on the meal, so it wouldn't have hurt), NOTHING. \n\nEverything aside, whether we were right or wrong, it's the the managers duty to make sure we had a good experience, and he could honestly have not been more condescending or cared less. Any other restaurant manager would have been horrified. \n\nDefinitely never coming back. There are better places to waste time for a $200 meal.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I decided to try this place out when a friend and I were looking for somewhere to go in the Charlotte area on a Friday night and we were both entirely over the typical club scene. We decided to check them out after reading some reviews online and we were not disappointed!! The food is awesome and very reasonably priced. The sushi is very popular here. The drinks aren't that strong, at least not to me, but I'm somewhat of a \"drinker\" so take that for what it's worth. Service was great. Our waiter took time to go over the menu with us and point out some of the more popular and highly recommended dishes. He was really patient and nice and he even brought me a free glass of wine from the bar. I have no idea why but I didn't question it! The only downside to this place is that it's really small but very popular so depending on what time you arrive, you may find yourself waiting for a long time to be seated. We arrived around 10pm and were told there would be a 45 minute wait. We were able to find a small space at the bar to hang out and ended up ordering a few drinks and some of their AMAZING Garlic fries while we waited. This place probably wouldn't be the best spot to take a large group of people but they do have group seating areas that can accommodate a small group of 5 or 6. Parking was free and close to the building so we didn't have to walk far. \n\nIf you decide to check it out it's a must you try the Garlic fries....by far the best fires I've ever had! I'd also recommend the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos (different but awesome), the Sushi Fondu, and the Korean BBQ Soul Wings.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This place is amazing. Tiny, but amazing nonetheless. \n\nSoul is tucked away in the second floor of a brick building in the busy, hip neighborhood of Plaza Midwood. There is ALWAYS a wait for a table at night and for brunch when available. They do not take reservations so if you're smart you'll try to get there early to get your name on the list. There have been several nights I've easily waited an hour and a half for a table and just went downstairs to 22 (an art gallery that serves alcoholic beverages) to have a couple beers before they sent a text saying our table was ready. \n\nSoul's menu consists of tapas and sushi. It's best to order 2 small plates per person and share everything. My favorites are the Soul Roll (sushi), Lamb Lollipops, Cheese Plate, Chimichuri Beef Skewers. Goat Cheese Balls and Tuna Tacos. You can't go wrong with anything at Soul. Also, ask your server for the daily specials. They're usually crazy unique and worth trying. \n\nThe atmosphere at Soul reminds me of a small hip restaurant in New York. A DJ spins while you eat dinner or sip on craft cocktails at the bar. The decor and small space make for a vibe that is inviting, warm, and eclectic. \n\nParking in this area of Plaza Midwood sucks so be on the lookout for tow-friendly spots. You can sometimes park at the parking lot across the street for $5. Good luck finding street parking at night.\n\nIf you're planning on making a night of it at Soul, bring some loot. For dinner and drinks for 2 people, you're likely to spend between $100-$150. Well worth it for a fun date night that's different from the usual. \n\nSoul should definitely be on your list of Charlotte restaurants to visit if it isn't already. It's an awesome spot for a date night or with a small group of friends. FYI, large tables will wait forever to be sat, if at all so keep it small!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Their music is always fantastic. Dishes can run on the small side, which I think can throw off some people that don't understand the tapas concept, but if you go in understanding that then you won't be disappointed. Another thing - like a true tapas place, they serve dishes as they are made and say so on their menu, so don't expect all your food to come out together. This does mean that all their dishes are exceptionally fresh. Also, mad props to the kitchen. I've never had anything less than perfect and they have a pretty big menu for such a small kitchen. Their servers are all really helpful and charismatic. Their hostesses could use some math lessons because they say the wait is going to be an hour or longer and then we are always seated within fifteen. Signature bar drinks can seem a bit pretentious, but bartenders have no problem making the drinks you actually want. In summary, this is my favorite place in Charlotte right now.\n\n\nFav dishes: Dirty South Nachos and Pork Belly Tacos. Both phenomenal and not to be missed.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's located off Central Avenue, which is quite eclectic, yet boasts a variety of great restaurants and food options.\n\nSoul is one of those places you seek to take out of towners, or \"newbies\" to Charlotte. The menu changes occasionally, yet there are some mainstay choices that are always available and you HAVE to try (i.e. pork belly watermelon tacos).\n\nSoul is a very small space, which gives it a cozy, friendly and intimate setting. They have a handful of tables, or you could find yourself on stools sitting closely to other couples. There is even a lounge area with couches and comfy chairs. If you're lucky enough to snag one of few tables on the porch outside, you have a gorgeous view of the city skyline. They also have a small bar where you can have a drink while you wait. While they don't take reservations, they have started taking down your cell phone number so you can check out some other places nearby (Peculiar Rabbit, Bistro La Bon) and they will text you when your table is ready. \n\nSoul is mostly known for their tapas style dishes, and they offer great sushi too. I've been a handful of times, though this was before I was into the phase if photographing my food. Some of my favorite dishes include the pork belly tacos (no brainer), the lam lollipops, the fried brussel sprouts, fried oysters, eggplant parm, grilled cheese, housemade gyro, and any of their current specials for dessert (They usually have outrageous combos of cupcakes that are so amazing). \n\nThings I wouldn't recommend - dirty south nachos (the fried chicken \"chips\" just weren't up to soul's standard), salads. There are too many other good things at soul, so I tell people to stay away from the salads. I'm a dietitian so I'm all about some additional veggies, but take my word on this.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":2}

I love everything about it, except the capacity.  It's easier to get a spot to eat when it's just me and my girlfriend or with 1 other couple. If you have more than 4 in your party, you will definitely have a good wait on the weekends.  That being said, I don't mind a wait when I'm dining here because I'll either get one of their finely crafted cocktails or go downstairs to Twenty-Two (See my review).  Once I get a table...IT'S ON.\n\nThe restaurant is a fusion of American, Greek, and Japanese (well, sushi mainly).  It's tapas style and I'll usually order 2 small plates at a time to split.  It's a pretty interesting menu when you bring all 3 of these together.  My favorite dish is hands down the sashimi tuna tacos.  My eyes usually roll into the back of my head as I savor each bite.  They just taste so fresh and smooth.  We always get the cheese plate to nibble on throughout the meal, and it's massive...a really good value.  The spanikopita is a favorite and we always get a roll of sushi.  They have great sushi.  The quality is there and you can taste it. They have a great brunch too, love the pimiento mac n' cheese.  They also have these breakfast pierogis with fried bologna and maple syrup.  That dish is out of this world.\n\nI love the selection of music (very loungy) and the patio overlooks the skyline of Charlotte.

Even though our server was otherwise great, he only served the table for 2, and only brought a third glass for water upon request.\nWe ordered two small plates: Rocky Mountain oysters (pretty good, too much cornmeal, which took away from the delicate flavor, in my opinion), and Shells stuffed with pulled pork in cheese sauce (the pork filling was on the dry side and overall underwhelming, even though the cheese sauce was delicious). My husband also had a steak and eggs sandwich, which was for some reason was served open-faced and pretty much impossible to eat as a sandwich. I tried a few bites - it was very under seasoned, although the quality of steak was top-notch. I ordered a chicken pita wrap - absolutely delicious, no complaints there. \nFor dessert we had the chocolate brioche bread pudding, which tasted more like a dry brownie; and banana turnovers, which were decent, but not more than that. \nA few other tables around us ordered food that looked and smelled much better. And the tables are so close together that you could really really see and smell what the other people are eating)) and hear their conversations, and occasionally rub elbows. \nI'm considering coming back in a solely grown up company, to try some of the cocktails, bone marrow, noodle bowl and the Korean bbq chicken wings. \nIt wasn't a terrible experience, but definitely a bit of a let down.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I don't understand how this is possible given that Twenty-Two is right below them with a laundry list of great beers.  However, their wine selection looked admirable but alas, I'm not a wine drinker so that's were a star is lost for me.\n   The Food:  Overpriced but delicious.  My order of Hummus was more filling than my entree of the Pork Belly tacos.  I will say that the Pork Belly was amazing especially when paired with Watermelon, which I wasn't expecting at all.  My friend ordered the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them much the same.\n  The Environment:  Trendy with various ambient, trip-hop music.  \nI think that this would be a great meet up place after dinner with non beer\ndrinkers.

Well, hidden as far as its location but a DEFINITE staple and favorite of Charlotte's locals!\n\nPicture this:\n1) Dimmed lighting that sets a classy-casual vibe mixed with random eclectic decor, such as a giant peacock embracing the brick walls with its luscious feathers \n2) Hungry Charlotte-ans filled with laughter as they line up by the bar, drinking and chit-chattering away as they WILLINGLY wait hours for a table\n3) Visiting guests who are embodied with anticipation as their minds are brainwashed by locals about how amazing the food is\n4) Eager faces and watering mouths as tapas are slowly brought out to their owners\n\nyummm.. makes me drool just reminiscing about the experience and especially my meal! Absolutely everything we ordered had an extra kick or zing that took me by surprise. Every \"normal\" dish offered, or so it was described, had an unexpected twist of flavors.\n\nWe ordered Wild Mushrooms On Toast (Panini), Ahi Tuna with Sesame & Soy Drizzle (Skewers), Sashimi Tuna Tacos (Tapas-Meze-Small Plates), Sticky Veal Short Ribs (Tapas-Meze-Small Plates), Soul Roll (Sushi: Soul Originals), Goat Cheese Ice Cream and Pistachio Ice Cream (Soul Made Ice Cream). All this for two little girls who, by the way, finished every last bite! In parentheses are the categories of each item. I would recommend any and all of these dishes, but my absolute favorite is the Sticky Veal Short Ribs! These were the most amazing short ribs I have ever had! The meat was so tender and the flavors oh so rich. The meat slid off the bone with ease and every bite was drenched with flavors!  Aside from the amazing short ribs, I have to say that Soul houses the best Pistachio Ice Cream.. IN THE WORLD! The entire meal was absolutely divine. I can't wait to come back!\n\nTIP: It's located upstairs, above a boutique, and can easily be missed if it's your first time. Be on the look out!","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":3}

Loads of variety, and well made and presented.  I haven't had anything here yet that I wasn't impressed by.\n\nThe cocktails are better than the food, if that's possible.  Knowledgeable barstaff make great drinks, and relatively quickly, too.\n\nSounds like a 5 star review, right?  Well, the thing that kills Soul is that it's gotten too popular for its own good.  There is always -- ALWAYS -- a wait to be seated, and they don't take reservations, which really grinds my gears.  If you want to sit down to a meal at night, the DJ is often playing too loud for you to have good conversation with your dinner company, and you'll likely spend a fair bit of coin to order enough small plates to make it a real meal.\n\nMaybe a 45 minute wait to sit down and eat appeals to some people - maybe it makes you feel like you're in New York, or that you're experiencing something truly special, or it gives your visit some sense of occasion.  For me, it makes me wonder why I'm not giving my time and money to any number of other really great food places within a quick walk, bike, or drive of Soul.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

First, a bit of advice: be prepared to wait for a while for a table on a Friday or Saturday night, and by a while I mean 1.5-2 hours. The atmosphere is very hip, and the patio\/balcony dining space was really interesting. The crowd was younger, which made the experience very fun and energetic.\n\nRegardless, the food is definitely worth the wait. We had a sashimi tuna taco, slow-cooked ribs, grilled chicken skewer, and a tuna sushi roll. I would describe the food as the best of East meets West. Especially the ribs and chicken skewer-- the presentation, the taste, dressings, and sauces reminded me a lot of Japan, where every detail matters. So much so that I kept saying the owner's must have lived in Japan for a while, but it turns out the owner is Greek...I was way off!\n\nI would highly recommend the tapas over the sushi.

(Unless you're a veg) Perfectly cooked, french cut (lollipop style) and served with amazing pecorino. Worth the cash you'll have to drop. Every time. \n\nCheese Plate: Good for sharing. Nice assortment. Manchego is fantastic. \n\nFRIED CHEESE: Not sure if this is always on the menu, but if it is you'll be hard pressed to stop eating it hand over fist. Amazing. \n\nPaninis: Mini Burgers, Mushrooms on toast and the Cubanini are my favs. Definitely a good go-to if you're in a pinch. \n\nDip Trio: tzatziki, hummus, babaganoush  are all great and interesting. \n\nThe only cons I can think of is getting a seat.

I could not wait to write this review.\n\nI have not encountered such poor customer service in a very long time, and that's saying something, as I currently live in New York City.  The hostess who \"greeted\" me was incredibly rude.  I use the word \"greeted\" very freely.  Basically, she looked me up and down expectantly as I walked in the door.  When I said nothing, obviously expecting a \"Hello\" or a \"Welcome\", she proceeded to sigh and grunt out a \"How many?\"  When I explained to her that I was meeting someone and pulled out my phone to text my friend to ask her if she wanted to sit inside or out, I was told, very rudely and abruptly, that the restaurant was \"obviously very small\" and that she would not seat me  until my party was complete.  Fine.  I understand that many restaurants have this policy.  I was making no complaint.  There's no need for such an attitude.\n\nA bit taken aback by her demeanor, I asked if I could wait at the bar, towards which I was waved with a scowl.  When my friend finally arrived, I tried to settle up with the bartender (for a single seltzer), and he said it was no problem and not to worry about it.  When we approached the hostess to claim a table, she looked at me very accusingly and said, \"Well did you settle your bar tab?\"  \n\nI've worked retail, I've worked food service - I know people have bad days, I know these jobs can really suck sometimes, but there is no excuse for attitude like that.

When we first got there, we were intrigued by the decor and atmosphere and didn't mind the wait (initially told it was going to be up to 1.5 hours, but that it could be much shorter). We left our phone number with the host and went to the bar next door for a drink. 45 minutes later, we called to check on our reservation and were told that they supposedly texted us 10 minutes prior as our table was ready (we did not get any texts).

We had to remind about the other two 20 minutes later when we realized nothing else was on its way. Then they continued to randomly bring out our tapas dishes without any thought to the order and with very long breaks in between. One of us didn't get any of her four orders for over 30 mins and had to watch others eat. There were two orders of grilled cheese and they came out 45 minutes apart after we inquired about the second one. They completely forgot a dish until we inquired about it at the end of our meal. Bone marrow was undercooked (they comped it on the bill without us saying anything about it, so we assume they knew). Our main waiter didn't remember anything any of us ordered and some orders were getting brought over by different people. Worst of all, we didn't receive much of an apology throughout the ordeal. All we got was a  dismissive \"it's that kind of night.\"\n\nThis is a real shame because this is a unique restaurant and lamb lollipops, sashimi, and tuna tacos were great.

I'll start off by saying the atmosphere is not for everyone. It's a small space where the tables are extremely close to one another it can be noisy. If you are willing to embrace the resulting conversations and meeting new people, then you also get the benefit of trying some of my favorite dishes and cocktails that the city of Charlotte has to offer. \n\nAgain, the space is small and they don't take reservations. Getting large crowds (4+) in is extremely difficult. While the no wait app has been a game changer, this place puts up ridiculous wait times so be prepared to go early. I also recommend trying one of the specialty cocktails here. Several big names in the Charlotte cocktail scene either started here or spent some time here. While I'm not sure who influenced who, I'll certainly enjoy the resulting drink menu they have to offer. \n\nRegarding food, I've tried many dishes over the last few years and only have had a handful that didn't blow me away. I would treat this place as an experience more than a meal, and have easily spent close to 2 hours in the past ordering dishes (1) or (2) at a time and often putting my experience in the hands of our waiter\/waitress as they are better versed in what is good for the night. Some highlights include the pork belly tacos, sashimi tuna tacos, and garlic truffle fries. Since the small plates can add up quick on my bill, I normally round out the night with a sushi roll as they tend to have more bang for your buck calorie to dollar wise.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Since my only other choice was to sit alone at common market, I followed them, and I was not sorry.  I had one of their sushi rolls...which roll it was is lost in the mist of time and many killed brain cells.  I do remember that it was a little spicy, a little creamy, a little crunchy, and I DEVOURED it.  \n\nI wasn't able to return until almost 4 years later, but I watched the twitter feed and my mouth watered at every special they posted.  Finally I was able to go there for brunch.  We shared the truffle fries which were amazing.  I don't know if they come with a dipping sauce, but we didn't get one, and we didn't need one.  I had the chicken and waffles and I once again devoured every bit.  It was also very reasonably priced for the amount of food.  I got a mimosa but I wish I had gotten a bloody mary because my friend's was delicious and came with all sorts of pickled goodies.  \n\nOh, also, they put a cucumber slice in the water, which is like a double boost of hydration for those of us who may or may not be - ahem - dehydrated from the night before.

It's old school with a touch of contemporary. The seating inside makes for a great date night setting or a fun night out with a good group of friends. There's outdoor seating on the patio as well which is what my girlfriend and I did. The weather was perfect and it had a nice bustle out there which was much appreciated. To complement this unique setting is the staff - everyone with their own unique personality and equally amazing. Our waiter was super fun and had great recommendations for us on not just food at Soul but also in the Charlotte area.

That is all. \n\nNo but seriously just get them because you won't regret it one bit.

With that, here's everything you need to know Soul...\n\n1. LOONG WAIT. The wait to get a table can be long. Very long.  I mean its pretty simple, do NOT go to Soul on Thursday or Friday night and expect to get in and out within 2hrs.  Therefore, I only go to Soul on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  Oh, and they don't accept reservations.\n\n2.  NO LUNCH.  That's right, Soul doesn't open until 5pm.  I usually try to get there a little later in the evening; usually after the main dinner rush, around 9pm or so.  \n\n3.  DJs & Tunes! I'm not 100% sure, but I believe they have a DJ on hand Thursday - Saturday nights starting around 9pm.  The DJ's are always on point with the music and really add to Soul's trendy vibe and reputation it has around Charlotte.  \n\n4. NO PARKING.  There's no parking lot, or area exclusively for Soul's patrons.  Your best bet is to park in the lot across the street near CVS (sometimes its $5), or anywhere else around the heart of Plaza Midwood (near Thomas Street Tavern\/Whiskey Warehouse) and walking over. \n\n5. The FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!  Although I've tried many items on the menu from the pork belly sliders, to the steak and eggs which both make my mouth water, my favorite item is the Sakana Roll.  Its a tuna, salmon, avocado, sushi roll lightly fried - simply the best sushi in Charlotte!  If sushi's not your thing, don't worry there's plenty of great menu items as I said the steak and eggs or any of the skewers are great.  The humus of the day and guac stack are both great tasting, lighter options.  The french fries w\/truffle oil are out of this world yummy!! \n\n6. HIP. COOL. VIBE.  I like Soul's ambiance so much because its the perfect representation of the people and culture of Plaza-Midwood and Charlotte as a whole.  Its young, hip, chill, and different.  Everything from the walk up the black steps, to the dark interior, to the tight bar, to the blue peacock hanging behind that same bar; create a happening, mellow vibe thats unmistakeable.  \n\nSoul perfectly in-captures everything I value in a dining experience. From the amazing and unique food, to the trendy ambiance, to the phenomenal service - everything pops at Soul.  Soul, what a great name for an establishment that truly represents the heart and soul of the Queen City.","useful":12,"funny":3,"cool":14}

It's usually just my mom dining with me, so that relieves some of the pressure of pleasing all 3 of us, which is truly an unenviable task. This time around I solicited the feedback of a few fellow Yelpers in Charlotte for some new places and decided Soul Gastrolounge offered up so many options on their menu that surely I could find something to satisfy us both.\n\nIt seemed to me that most of the complaints people had with this place revolved around the wait to get in, or just poor service in general, but I can definitely assure you we had neither of these problems (although mom likes to eat dinner early, so we got there a little after 6PM). In fact our server Marlon was one of the most attentive I've ever had, and constantly updated us on the progress of our items, since we ordered so many different plates. The pace of the food was all done well, and only at one point was our table completely overflowing with dishes, to which we just stole some space from the one next to us for a few minutes. All of the drinks came out within just a few minutes of ordering as well. Maybe we just got lucky, but this service was on point the whole night.\n\nAt first glance the huge menu here seems to be a total mishmash of things from all over the globe, prepared in every way imaginable, the kind of thing that Gordon Ramsay would come into a restaurant and blow a gasket over. After a little further examination though you can see some of the connections, although I still think they should do away with a few sections altogether and focus more on the remaining dishes. The pricing of everything here (with the exception of the $18 lamb lollipops) is all pretty fair though, so you can try just about anything on the menu without a huge investment, a nice departure from the \"small plate\" pricing schemes in DC.\n\nWe began with their spicy feta dip, which had a nice thick texture but I couldn't get past the strong Pimento cheese flavor, something that quickly reminded me I was back in NC. I did like it, but not sure I would recommend it. Next out were the Boursin cheese stuffed piquillo peppers served over mini-bruschettas. The flavors here were a bit muted for me, something my mom was a fan of, but I guess that's due to my inexperience with piquillos and expecting them to be spicy rather than sweet. So, if that's more your style then this dish is definitely done properly. The last of our teaser bites was easily my favorite, the French fries with garlic-herb salt and truffle oil, and we wound up snacking on them throughout the whole meal as a nice base point for flavors when we wanted to alternate back and forth. The truffle presence is pretty potent here but the herb flavors do a good job balancing it...definitely request some of the spicy mayo for dipping!\n\nOur first meat dish to come out was the chimichurri beef skewers, really well cooked cubes of beef with a hint of pink and a side of dipping sauce. Thankfully the chimichurri was for dipping, because it was a big disappointment compared to other versions I've had, but at least the meat was good. The sticky veal shortribs with the five spice honey glaze though were superb. The meat falls right off the bone as it should and maintains tenderness throughout. I really loved the traditional Asian flavor combo of hoisin and five spice here too. The lamb lollipops are clearly the star of the show here, although I wish the rosemary flavor was a bit more pronounced...and I hardly ever say this, but they cooked have been cooked just a bit longer to get a nice sear on the outside.  My favorite dish came next, the pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa. We were worried they wouldn't be available, as our waiter told us there was currently a watermelon shortage, but someone managed to find some and deliver it to the restaurant just in time, whew. Glad they did, as this was a unique flavor combination for me that really worked brilliantly. The high didn't last long though, as I was thoroughly disappointed with the shrimp ceviche, mainly due to the coconut milk base which was entirely too sweet.\n\nDessert was a mixed bag, with the eggnog cupcake being OK, thanks in part to a heavy dose of rum-spiked frosting, and the pistachio ice cream being much better. There are nice big pieces of whole pistachios mixed into the ice cream which not only enhanced the flavor but added a nice textural element.\n\nI really appreciated the effort they're putting into the cocktail menu here as well. At just $10 a piece you can get some pretty creative combinations, such as the Dark N' Spicy using dark rum, ginger liqueur, Saranac ginger beer and fresh lime juice, much better than the \"Stormy\" version. Basil Smash was also good, but the Sweet Heat had too much syrup and not enough kick.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":5}

It's about to get really sappy, sorry in advance. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went to Soul Gastrolounge on our first real date, March of 2016. Everything was SEAMLESS. Everything WORKED. Our service was great, server was very attentive and knowledgeable. The ambience was cool and casual, the lighting was perfect. The music and the style was trendy but not super stuck up. The perfect environment for any date night. \n\nNow the food, the most important part of any restaurant review on Yelp. To put it into perspective, this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and one of my fave in the US, period. My personal fave are the sashimi tuna tacos and the ceviche. Sooooo yummy! I've tried a bunch of other things on the menu and there has not been one single thing I haven't liked. It's Tapas style and there's something on the menu for every taste I think. Drinks: they're strong, so be careful. I couldn't handle more than 2, these bartenders are generous with the alcohol. \n\nAlso, my bf went to eat here alone on his birthday once while I was unfortunately out of town for work. I called the restaurant and asked if they'd let me buy him a drink and dessert and they cooperated in helping me surprise him and let me pay with my card. Pulled it off perfectly. Almost 2 years later we are now a happy couple and Soul Gastrolounge still provides the perfect setting for date night and still delivers on the great food and service. Thank you Soul for orchestrating the perfect first evening for us. This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and one of my fave in the U.S. An absolute MUST HAVE while in Queen City.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":4}

I have never been dissapointed with the food at Soul, and the chef is constantly adding new and innovative dishes to the classics on the menu. \n\nThere's not a bad seat in the house but my favorites in order are: outside on the small patio on a nice day, inside at the low couch table if I'm with 3-4 people, and at the DJ bar if I'm with one other person. Don't expect to sit at the bar unless you get there right at 5pm. If you come later than 5pm, expect a short wait. Grab one of the incredible drinks made by the well-informed bartenders and mingle with the other patrons or stand outside on the patio and admire the view of Uptown Charlotte. \n\nThere are so many different items to explore on the menu but my \"don't miss\" favorites are: Pork Belly Tacos (order 3), Shells and Cheese (sinfully delicious), Brussel Sprouts (never taste this good when I cook them), Soul Roul (yes, their sushi is GREAT), Ahi Tuna tacos, and the Lamb Lollipops.

In reality we weren't seated for three hours, and it would have been longer if my friend and I weren't walking out the door.  The issue was that instead of giving us our well deserved table, the host was allowing his \"friends\" to cut in front of us.  This is, in my opinion, completely unacceptable.   \n\nMy second biggest issue involves the bartender.  To pass time my friend and I were going to have some drinks at the bar, but our experience was terrible.    I am absolutely unashamed to call out the bartender right now.\n\nAlthough I don't know his name, I can describe him. He has very strange hair that is shaved on one side and flipped on the other, and wears these steam-punk inspired glasses.  Let me say, this guy is a complete jerk and should not be working in the hospitality industry PERIOD. \n\nMy friend and I were  standing at the bar waiting for a drink for 45 minutes.  He was blatantly ignoring us.  Everytime I waved at him he would say \"I will get to you in a minute\" however, during this period at least 10 other people, if not more, were served who were not waiting before us and just got to the bar.  In fact, some girl walked up to the left side of the bar after we were patiently waiting, (which by the way is not allowed) and was served.  This happened not once, but twice, and no she was not a waitress.  Finally when I was able to get my drink from him he asked for my I.D.  which is totally fine except I was already being served alcoholic beverages.  When I told this his was response was \"you should take that as a compliment\".  I honestly believe the only reason he made me take out my I.D was to harass me and make my life more difficult since my friend and I were obviously getting upset with him.    \n\nBottom line is, the wait sucked but if I had a pleasurable experience at the bar it wouldn't have mattered.  Not to mention my friend and I were planning on drinking a lot so the bartender screwed his own pocket out of valuable tips, as well as the restaurant.  Because of that, I will not be coming back to this place, which I am a pretty frequent customer of.  This gentleman may be a good bartender, but it is blatantly obvious that he shows favoritism to certain customers and I hope that the restaurant sees this review and takes it into consideration whether to keep him or not.  My review doesn't do it justice how rude he was.\n\n\nOn a side note, the other male bartender was very charming.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0}

It was ok.  Nothing special, not too much flavor - but it was white beans.  \n\nNext, the chorizo.  WARNING - this was the most disgusting thing I've ever been served.  I couldn't tell if it was raw or just packed full of fat.  It was falling apart in the casing and was so chewy we never actually got to the point of swallowing.  \n\nThe sardine fries were interesting.  They were mini sardines (full body - head to tail) deep fried with dipping sauce. \n\nLastly, the lamb lollipops.  These were also no good.  They were so fatty and a little overcooked.  \n\nI think the menu was good in theory with a horrible execution.  It seemed like they were trying to be too fancy and didn't quite cut it.

Everyone seems pretty cool and laid back.  If you are sick of Thomas Street or you've grown out of Snug Harbor, this could be your new hang out.  \n\nIf you're looking for a nice meal, look somewhere else.

We originally had tried to move the tables together, but we were stopped by the staff that said \"we're not doing that\" in a 2nd grade teacher tone. I understand moving tables can be frowned upon but we were in a corner outside and were not told during our 2 hour wait that we would not be seated together.

I generally prefer to hit the bar up after work on a weekday when the crowds are sparse and they play interesting tunes.  On weekends, however, the wait for a table gets too crazy (although you can head to 22 below while you wait, which is a new plus), the service can suffer, and it gets way too boom-boom club for my taste.  I also have noticed a steady increase in their prices since they've opened, but it can still be an affordable place if you order carefully.\n\nThat aside, I've had pretty good food here over the past year or so.  I think there was a period--maybe in the summer of this year--where they missed the mark a few times when I visited, but I'm happy to say that on my most recent visits, it's been quite nice.  \n\nMy standbys usually are the mini-Cheeseburgers, the Cheese Plate (mainly for the quince, which is delicious ,but I always have to ask for more bread), the truffle fries, and most of the sushi rolls.  \n\nSo, enjoy Soul, but I recommend it during the off hours.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

So fresh and drizzled with some siracha mayo.  Oh yes mouthgasm.  I honestly am drooling on my keyboard right now.  The second time I was here I had the lamb lollipops which I haven't seen in a while.  So friggin good. The steak and egg was great for a good snack as well.

This was one of the few bars open during the week day during late  hours (points for that). When you walk up the outside stair way, the business offers seating on the balcony and I believe I saw heaters outside as well - for the patrons that choose to sit outside on the cold nights. My sister and I were freezing so we opted to sit inside. The seating in here seems a little limited to me but my sister in law says they often draw large crowds at this establishment. After we took our seat, our waitress came over to welcome us and take our drink order. I wasn't too impressed by the speciality drink selection options but ended up trying the The Golden King (this one has rum in it). When the drink came back my taste buds could not tell me if I actually liked the drink or if I didn't like the drink. I think I liked the drink because I finished it or maybe due to the price I finished it. To me the Golden King is stronger drink, so I don't suggest it if you are looking for something sweet. Next my sister ordered a white dip. This came with pita chips. The dip was cream cheese tasting dip, something i never had before and tasted ok. Finally I opted to order some sushi. Now this was really good! I can't remember the name of the roll but I took a picture. After I ate dinner I really wanted a cupcake but the only make one flavor of the day.

We arrived at 8:00pm on a Monday and were surprised to find out there was a 30 minute wait. Around 30 min later we were sat at the bar and the food was more than worth the wait.\n\nWe started out with four dishes; Baba Ghanoush dip, anchovy bruschetta, lamb cheek profiteroles, and curried lamb skewers. The Baba ghanoush with pita chips was smoky and spicy, probably the best I've ever had. The marinated Spanish white anchovies on Bruschetta were refreshing, lite, and full of flavor, everything on the bruschetta was super fresh. The profiteroles for me were by FAR the highlight of the meal and one of the top 5 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. The kitchen was on point because everything on this plate was perfection. It was the first time I've had savory profiteroles which I thought was very creative, they were stuffed with tender lamb cheek, mushroom jam, and a foie gras  mousse. The three ingredients just kind of melted together and although the portion was small, they were so rich that it really ended up being the perfect amount. I would normally have a heart attack after paying $18 for 3 golf ball sized \"sandwiches\" but these were so good that we will probably order them every time we go back! The last dish of our first go around was the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney. The lamb was cooked and seasoned well, but there wasn't anything necessarily special about the lamb itself. But, the mango chutney was perfection, and we probably could've eaten a few bowls of that on its own. The pairing of the curry with the sweetness of the mango worked perfectly and definitely elevated the flavor of the lamb.\n\nOur second go around we ordered the Rocky Mountain Oysters, Sakana Roll, and Korean BBQ wings. The choice of the Rocky Mountain Oysters was really just out of curiosity. I always see Food Network hosts eating them when they're in Colorado and I was curious to taste them. They were perfectly cooked and incredibly tender, but I just did not care for the taste. They were good and my husband ended up eating the whole plate, but there is nothing in this world I hate more than liver, and although very mild, they did have a slight liver taste. The Sakana roll was pretty good and I really liked the combination of sauces that they served it with. Finally we had the Korean BBQ wings which were cooked perfectly. They were tender, very moist, and very flavorful.\n\nThe only disappointment of the night was dessert. I was eyeing the goat cheese ice cream since I first opened up the menu and when we ordered it the waitress told us they no longer make that flavor and we must have received an old menu. That was kind of a buzzkill, but we moved on and ordered the Vietnamese coffee ice cream. This is definitely not a cheap restaurant, but up until dessert, everything we ordered was more than worth the price. The ice cream scoop was $4 and it was about a 3oz scoop barely larger than a golf ball. I guess we're kind of picky because we make ice cream at home a lot, but our 1st shot at Vietnamese coffee ice cream was better than that. It was not a huge deal, just kind of anticlimactic after such delicious savory dishes.\n\nMy husband also ordered an Old Fashioned and said it was delicious. Lastly, the DJ was fantastic and one of the highlights of the night. We were seated right in front of him which was entertaining, and he was playing old school records all night which was the perfect type of music to accompany our food!\n\nAll in all it was one of the best meals we've ever had and cannot wait to go back. My husband thinks we can try the whole menu in 3 more visits, which I think is a bit ambitious, but I'm sure we will get there eventually!","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Seriously you can go in at 10 PM and still have to wait 30 mins for a table (this did happen btw) But the wait is worth it. Make sure to always get the truffle fries! The kabobs are damn good and so are sliders. But their lamb chops certainly are my fav. We have even done brunch there and the menu is almos tthe same and so is the wait lol. Bt the bloody mary's make up for it!! Definitely a fun place to take your friends...be prepared for a wait, make sure to take in some drinks and just enjoy it all.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Asheville. It felt just like I was in downtown Asheville eating at one of the fun and laid back restaurants that makes that city so different from Charlotte. I love going to a restaurant where you know it will not be replicated literally 20 miles away, no chain feeling here. Soul has a unique menu with lots to choose from. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are fun so that you can order a variety with friends when you go. I would highly recommend the Tuna Taco, that was my favorite. There were so many tasty items I had trouble narrowing it down which often times I have trouble finding anything on the menu. Try this place out and you won't be disappointed!

And there is a major reason there is a wait.  BECAUSE THE FOOD HERE IS FREAKING DELICIOUS!!\n\nI went here with a group, and we decided to devour everything in our path.  Here are some of the must haves:\n\n1.) The Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos.....are you kidding me??  These were some of the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth.  I could take a bath in that glaze.  And topped with watermelon....who was the genius who came up with that?  I want to marry that person.\n\n2. Sashimi Tuna Tacos.  Prior to eating here, I wanted nothing to do with raw anything.  I am a changed woman after having had these tacos.  Between these and the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos, this could have been my whole meal and I would have gone home happy.  But there is more.....\n\n3. Fried Brussel Sprouts..... fan-freaking-tastic.  Maybe not the most exciting thing to order, but so delicious all the same.\n\n4. The dips.  Oh yum, the dips.  We had tzatziki, babaganoush, and white bean dip.  With crisp pita chips.  No, I don't weigh 500 pounds.  But after having to physically sit on my hands so I wouldn't lick these dips from my fingers, I probably should.\n\n5. I was told that this place has some of the best sushi in the city.  So of course I had to order a roll.  And I was not disappointed.  I got the Red Dragon Roll, and one of the others in my group got the Dancing Tuna Roll.  Orgasm in my belly.   \n\n6. Various members of my group got different types of skewers.  Chicken, chimchurri beef, and gyros.  Now while I didn't try all of these personally, the fact that these skewers disappeared into various bellies within minutes of hitting the table likely speaks volumes as to how good they were.  \n\n7.  OH MY GOD, THE TRUFFLE FRIES.  THE MOTHER-FREAKING TRUFFLE FRIES. \n\nMy only caveat is that we were so full by the end that we could not possibly fit in another bite and so did not get to try dessert.  But it's okay because I will be back very very soon to eat my way through the rest of the menu.  \n\nThis place is absolutely, 100% worth waiting for a table.  Spend the wait by going to the bar for one of their cocktails, the Nude Beach and the Cucumber Mule are so delicious and refreshing that you may just forget that you went there to eat......though I wouldn't recommend that.  Ask for Matt as a server, if nothing I mentioned above sounds appealing (and if it doesn't, just forget about going, because you obviously have no taste), then Matt will definitely recommend something on the menu that will have you licking your plate, he knows his stuff for sure.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Also ordered the spanokopitia which was disappointing.   The phyllo was dry and not buttery and there was a scant amount of feta to balance the spinach.   The linguini special was very good as was the grilled ceaser salad.   The sushi looked amazing and some of the other small plates looked worthy of a second try.

The only disappointing part was there was a slight taste of something else (maybe fishy). Perhaps it was time to change the oil that they finish the pork belly in. The fish on the Soul Roll was fantastic but the roll could have used some more flavor. The Dirty South nachos were over the top indulgent and I loved them.

Nice, thats a drink at the bar first!\n\nThe bar had a spacious standing area that I was happy about. (I hate lurking over peoples shoulders so that our feet are in the \"bar area\"). About a drink in and another on the way, we began talking to the group beside us and found out a few went to the same college as my friend which spurred more chat. It must have been twenty minutes later...(although I was now 3 drinks complete hhmm), when the hostess signaled us to a large table nearby. Our new friends were still waiting so we invited them as well. \n\nThe place had such a great energy that everyone was feeling the buzz. We ordered more drinks which was when I was introduced to the Firefly Peach cocktail.

My party of 3 was quoted a wait time of 45 mins to an hour, however after over an hour of waiting we started to notice party after party walking in and getting seated right away, including a party of 6. We spoke with the hostess who informed us she can't seat a party of 3 in a 6 person booth. Even if we've been waiting so long? They'll keep it empty until the required number of people show up? Doesn't make sense. \n\nOnce we got seated I spoke with a manager and let me tell you I have never had worse customer service coming from a MANAGER. He completely dismissed my concerns by simply saying there were things I didn't understand. He made it perfectly clear that my experience was none of his concern and I was not valued as a customer.\n\nIt is clear Soul Gastrolounge only cares about one thing, and that is the money, and not customer service. Needless to say, an hour and a half wait and $200+ tab is not worth it to be treated so unwelcoming.\n\nI might add that, despite running food to our table several times, this manager never once checked in to see how the rest of our experience was.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Despite loving all three of them, the dips lasted us all our courses, and there was still so much leftover at the end.\n\nWith guidance from our server, we ordered the Korean BBQ wings, dirty nachos and pork belly tacos.\n\nThe wings were super tender, and the sauce wasn't anything I expected. Honestly, I could've done without the dirty nachos; the chicken skins tasted almost burnt and the pimento cheese seemed to be just melted American. The pork belly tacos were by far my favorite, and they are reasonably hyped. Sweetness of the pork belly was perfectly balanced with the sourness of the watermelon.\n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate brioche bread pudding with a miso caramel ice cream.

It's okay just keep reading it gets better I promise. I just had to! Originally this was going to be a 5 star review but after a prompt return visit the hostess's bitchiness and ineptitude caused me to take away a star. More on that later. Buckle up kids this is going to be a long review.\n\nI probably have to give Soul the award for some of the most creative and tastiest cuisine I've ever had in Charlotte. Yes it's that good. Even when you order something that sounds fairly normal, they managed to give it a creative twist. I'm so appreciative of that! The interior is very small, crowded and very loud. So be prepared for a long wait sometimes, especially since they don't take reservations. But the staff is nice without being over the top, and water refills are kept up. I especially like that they serve it with cucumber instead of the usual lemon. I never like the taste of lemon in water, but I do love the flavor a slice of cucumber can infuse!\n\nMy first trip here I went with tuna sashimi tacos, an amazing duck confit pasta topped with crispy sweetbreads and foie gras, and grilled toast topped with wild mushrooms and a fried egg with a Dijon vinaigrette. Finished with last but not least goat cheese ice cream. This meal contained probably some of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere in Charlotte. \n\nLets start with the tuna tacos, I've had something similar to this dish while I was in Cali, it was a deconstructed fish taco and so I was excited to find it here! It did not disappoint at all! The guacamole was flavorful and added dimension and fattiness to the tuna while the fried wonton wrapper gave it a lovely crunch, yum.\n\nNext up came the duck confit pasta, now if the last dish was awesome this would qualify as a masterpiece. The duck confit paired with the delivered such amazing flavors that this dish could have easily fit into a high class restaurant. The foie gras' earthiness and richness complemented the pasta and gave it amazing depth of flavor, while the crispy sweetbreads brought the whole dish together some much needed texture. This dish is best eaten in small amounts though because it had such a rich, luxurious mouthfeel I felt quite sated after finishing half of the plate.\n\nThe last savory course of the evening was grilled wild mushrooms with a dijon vinaigrette over charred toast and topped with a fried egg. I wasn't even going to get this dish because I was quite full but I saw the table next to us get it and I had to have it. I thought this dish was the most balanced of the night with complex flavors and textures melding together in glorious harmony. Just get the thing and you'll be singing it's praises too.\n\nFeeling like an overstuffed plush at this point, I decided to go all in and order the goat cheese ice cream. You could taste the grassiness of the goat cheese and the ice cream felt surprisingly low fat which surprised me. I think I'd prefer it if the flavor kicked me in the face next time like *WHAM* that's goat cheese alright! and maybe make the ice cream a bit more decadent? I just feel like you want to go all out for dessert and this let me down a bit.\n\nThe music here is very very very loud. I couldn't hear what my dining partner about a foot away was saying, I almost contemplated just texting each other across the table. The hostess the first time was perfectly nice, but my second time was so rude, unfriendly, and nasty that I just took my business elsewhere. For such excellent food though I'll brave all these missteps and take my chances.","useful":8,"funny":7,"cool":7}

The exposed brick of the restaurant combined with the unique lighting was very appealing. Marlon was our server and he was INCREDIBLE. Well-spoken, knew the menu, made great suggestions and held great conversation. My date and I started off with the Godzilla Roll and Cheese Panini. Both very tasty. I then ordered the Lamb Skewer and she ordered the Mini Burgers. 3rd round consisted of Piquillo Pepper Toasts and Gyro Skewer. Everything was so good, my least favorite was the Gyro Skewer... it was just meat on a stick and a bit dry. My favorite... oh man. Those Lamb Skewers were incredible. I'd order like 30 of them as appetizer, meal AND dessert. They were so juicy and flavorful. I will definitely come back here!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Never have I had a bad experience.  The food is inventive, delicious and decadent.  The atmosphere is intimate and has a very cool vibe.  Be prepared to watch your neighbors expressions as their food is brought out - you will start having discussions about the intricate flavors and presentation and find yourself sharing with complete strangers.\n\nI absolutely cannot go here without ordering at least two of the Pork Belly Watermelon Tacos.  Those alone are worth the trip.  This evening, we tried one of the specials - tempura asparagus with garlic aioli...yes, please!  We did ask for some extra aioli on the side and continued to sample it throughout the entire meal.  Next up was the Soul Roll - spicy salmon, cukes, jalapeño, sliced white tuna, wasabi aioli, spicy mayo sauce  - just enough kick to finish off the delicate white tuna.  \n\nWe followed the roll with the Pan Con Tomate  - Spanish chorizo, whipped manchego, rioja reduction - the fresh garlic and whipped manchego literally made me want to scrap the plate clean.  And don't miss out on the Flatbread with truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto,\nhoney braised garlic and fresh arugula - one of my favorites to start the meal.  Just enough sweet with fresh arugla and how can you go wrong with goat cheese?!\n\nIf you care to partake in a drink - try the pink sake - tastes like a light, crisp sweet champagne.

Unfortunately, we have decided never to go back due to the consistently and rather shockingly nasty attitudes of the host staff. We have experienced it ourselves, as well as seeing it directed at other guests. On almost every visit, we have seen at least one party take their name off the list due to the rudeness of the hostess. Normally, when I read a review like this one, I take it with a grain of salt because I have worked in the restaurant business and I know how rude the customers themselves can be, but I assure you that neither we nor the others we have observed being treated rudely have done anything to bring it on ourselves. There is simply no food that is good enough to be worth this kind of disrespect. For good food AND friendly staff, walk a block in either direction to go to The Diamond or to Dish or, for sushi, take a quick drive to Niko.

Laid back atmosphere with bar seating, table\/booth, and even couches and chairs. Being tapas you can tell people hang out for hours casually and munch. Probably why the wait is so long.

We finally made it back for dinner last night and suffered only an hour wait. Soul is a busy place, let me tell you. While it IS very small, I can see why it takes so long to be seated: it's not a normal restaurant where one would order their meal, have it delivered, eat it, and then leave. No, not at Soul. Once we were seated we ordered a round of tapas... which did come out rather quickly... ate them... decided we wanted to order more... and more. This is a process in itself. Our group of 4 agreed on 3-4 dishes at a time, probably totalling 8-10 tapas and 2 cupcakes during our visit. Soul is known for their sushi, but I personally thought the lamb skewers, brussel sprouts, pork tacos and fried clams (the special) were my personal favorites. Sadly I woke up in the middle of the night with a HORRIBLE stomach ache- a lot of fried food, and while it comes in small portions, it is deceiving. Beware. We have been eating a lot of meatless\/healthy\/raw lately, so don't let the size of the tapas fool you. That stuff is heavy. Ah- and how can I forget the fried goat cheese? It was divine.

This isn't some one night five star fling review ;) Soul consistently delivers when it comes to food and drink.\n\nSoul is a cozy, hip restaurant that has an upstairs entrance. It also boasts a patio (that's heated during the winter months) which provides an abbreviated view of the skyline. They have a beautiful bar that's pretty much the centerpiece of the space. Ladies: there's an added bonus for bar seating. They have purse hooks!! As for restaurant seating? well...I'm not lying when I say it's cozy. There are about two-three booths and then rest of the seating consists of tables that can be grouped together or broken a part for two person seating. Trust me, you'll be so focused enjoying every bite of your food that you won't be worried about your proximity to your neighbor(s).\n\nBack to the bar....the bartenders make THE BEST DRINKS. I've enjoyed their  summer version of the moscow mule which includes cucumber - yum - and their winter version called the winter's mule. The winter's mule is hands down my favorite drink and I was that person sucking down every last drop of the drink through her straw.\n\nAs for the food....there is so much to say. The place covers Asian, Greek, Spanish, American cuisines with such understated flair and sophistication. Clearly there's a reason why the pork belly tacos are so well-documented because THEY ARE DELICIOUS. Simply put, you absolutely must get those if\/when you go there. It's like a rule. Every time I've been to Soul, I always get a sushi roll of some sort. They are very creative with the flavors and I'm always pleased. \n\nSoul does not have a designated parking lot. Don't even bother thinking about parking in the CVS lot because they will either tow your car or yell at you when you walk back to your car (mentioning this from past experience). If you're lucky, grab a spot in the lot that's across Pizza Peel\/The Dish and walk over or park in the Bistro La Bon\/Healthy Home Market lot. Also, don't even think about not having to wait on a weekend night. If you're like me and don't enjoy waiting long periods of time for food (although this place is worth it), come on a Tuesday\/Wednesday evening.\n\nBeing that the place serves tapas-style plates, be prepared to spend a little more $$$. It's by no means a cheap place (well...depending on your appetite) and it's worth every penny.","useful":16,"funny":5,"cool":9}

Literally they were talking about tacos, wings, sushi, ramen, mac and cheese, paninis, and the list goes on. When I heard of all the choices, I thought it must be one of those spots that don't do anything really well so they just go for pure diversity so while I was apprehensive about heading to this joint as my last meal for my final work trip to Charlotte, I decided to be open minded and give it a shot. This joint is located in an area which has apparently gone through a lot of modifications\/upgrades over the recent years according to my friend. The spot itself is up a flight of stairs and there are some patio seats outside and the moment you step inside, you see a bar along with a few booths and tables around. \n\nThe spot has a policy of only seating tables when your entire party has arrived so something to keep in mind if you are going with a large group. We were seated quickly given our group was present and we were given menus quickly after. Sure enough this place has a ton of options and while we had a tough time narrowing it down, we went with Asian Glazed pork belly tacos, lamb lollipops, Dirty South Nachos, Shells and Cheese, Korean Chicken Wings, the Cuban panini, and the Red Dragon Roll. We also ordered off the drink menu as the bar had an extensive menu so should be a lot of options for any type of drinker. The Asian Glazed pork belly tacos were out first and they were good. The pork belly was tender and while the watermelon chunks were a bit big, it actually was not overwhelming. A solid fusion starter for sure. The Dirty south Nachos were out next and these were really good although the presentation of it was quite interesting. The pimento cheese fondue was good but it wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for and ended up being just a bit too much cheese for me. The lamb lollipops were by far my least favorite and I would recommend staying away from it. The meat was a bit tough to eat and there wasn't a ton of flavor on this but we ended up ordering enough food to not be starving. The Shells and cheese were good and while I did not think the BBQ pork would go well, it ended up being a solid dish and I was pleasantly surprised. The Korean chicken wings were Good and I bet they are probably considered very good given the lack of Korean restaurants in Charlotte. A good dish for the local market so props to them for it. The Cuban panini was very solid and definitely a crowd pleaser. The meats were tender and it was the right balance of all the ingredients to make it a tasty panini. The roll that we ordered ended up being solid for rolls. I don't eat too many rolls anymore but it tasted like a solid roll and the fish quality was good surprisingly. A hidden surprise and I think something that would do well in the CLT market.\n\nAll in all, I think the food was good at this joint. I actually want to give this joint a lot of props for trying a lot of different fusion combinations that while sound weird, actually ended up being Good in the end.

Came here with friends on a late night Friday for some drinks and small plates. We were seated at the outdoor balcony within 5 minutes of walking up and the view of the Charlotte skyline was pretty cool at night. Our server was super chill and gave some great recommendations on items to try since it was our first time. We ate about everything on the menu haha. Never in my life could I have thought to order hummus, Korean bbq wings, pecan seared trout, sushi rolls, flatbreads, or aioli french fries and been so impressed with the quality or the inventiveness of the kitchen. I even pitched in and invented my own plate- a cheese grilled cheese stuffed with marinated baby portobello mushrooms. Everything was spectacular!

By the time we made it over to Soul, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. Now, I will agree with others that they squeeze you in there tight (which is typically not my cup of tea). BUT after a few delicious cocktails, my husband and I suddenly didn't care what the couple at the table next to us was chatting about. \n\nThe food OH the food! Almost everything we had was superb. We of course ordered the Asian pork belly tacos (which I dream about now, thanks Soul), a sushi roll (I can't remember the name), the fried goat cheese bruschetta, the fried Brussels sprouts (not a fan, I thought they were a little too charred), and stuffed shells with pork BBQ (!!!). Our waiter was fantastic (I can't remember his name, unfortunately) and we liked the fact that the tapas came out one right after the other (instead of feeling overwhelmed by all of them at the same time).

Isn't North Carolina known for it's BBQ & hence amazing meat preparation?\n\nThe pork belly was chewy vs melt in your mouth tastiness. Plus it was really just a pork belly tapa vs a taco because there was no way the measly flour shell could wrap around the large pork + watermelon layers.\n\nIt was decently busy, but Sunday busy so I expected better service. Honestly it nailed all the hipster bar cliches. Busy with loud music, over priced attempts at fusion food & prohibition style cocktails & stand offish people. \n\nI'd come here with friends for a drink on a weekday, but not worth the hype IMO.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But back to the food: ordering a bunch of different tapas (and even sushi rolls) is the way to go. I love the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos -- the pork is cooked to such perfection that it literally does melt in your mouth, a very popular tapa among customers.

The pita chips that came with it we nice and healthy (since they were baked not fried).\n\n2. Eggplant Parmesan skewers -\nThis was the best dish I tried in soul! The eggplant and cheese was cut into perfect chunks and breaded and crisped to perfection. The marinara sauce (which I hope was made in the house and not store bought) was great to accompany the dish. All in all perfect! Must try for everyone.\n\n3. Flatbread -\nWas good. The pesto was delicious although, the honey braised garlic made it somewhat sweet (which is the point) but didn't do anything. If you love cheese and pesto on bread, go for it!\n\nPita sandwich with falafel -\nAgain, a great dish. Nothing innovative here, but a good soft pita with tomatoes and tender tasty falafels. I liked it! Vegetarians will definitely love this one. \n\nDessert - chocolate brioche cake with ice cream -\nGood warm cake with nuts and tasty caramel syrup to moisten it while the ice cream melts! Good dessert!\n\nAnd after so much food, what we paid was unbelievably reasonable (just $38) ! That's the best part.. it's gourmet food at cheap pricing! \n\nI've been waiting to go to this place since forever.

It's a great that  only 7 of us were present- we were packed in the booth like sardines. Regarding the food- it was everything the reviews mentioned. I had the guacamole stack- try it if you are a fan of avocado, the flatbread- my favorite, and the truffle fries, my second favorite. I also tried the Korean wings- too spicy for my taste, fried meatballs- just ok, nothing special, lemon chicken skewer-they were ok, I would not order them again, and a host of other items. The last thing I tried was the pistachio ice cream. It was no bueno!!! It was completely tasteless. The server was nice enough to remove it from my tab.

FYI, glasses of wine are also 1\/2 off during happy hour.\n\nGreat music selection (from Beastie Boys to Zeppelin), attentive bartenders, and quirky but classy decor -  I D.U.G.

The service is really hindered by a management practice of being under staffed. Our server apologized to us for a bottle neck at the bar because there was only one bartender on Saturday night at the busy hour. I asked if someone hadn't showed up, and she said, no, this is normal. We always have one bartender who goes insane trying to keep up at this time. Guess the customers' satisfaction and the bartender's sanity is not worth an extra hand. The beer selection is decent, and since you're paying strip prices, and each beer takes 15 minutes minimum, we got a whole pitcher of tripel. No complaints there! The food was good, and of course priced high. I got the lobster rolls which were so widely lauded. I was disappointed that the main ingredient was butter, and it overpowered every other flavor, ESP the lobster. I rubbed all the butter off a piece of lobster to be able to taste it, and it was honestly not very good without its butter bath. Disappointed that a supposedly high end restaurant cannot make a good lobster dish without applying a butter solution to mask any other flavor. The chili burger was actually really good. I recommend that one. We sat outside and enjoyed great people watching while we waited long spells between service visits. Overall, you could do worse on the strip.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This should come as no surprise. NICKEL PBR. Need I say more? \n\nI went here for dinner and beer with my boyfriend and some friends. I was surprised by their selection of beers. Not quite as large as Yardhouse, but impressive nonetheless. I ordered a Kronenbourg 1664, which is a usual of mine. I had some trouble ordering from the menu because nothing was exactly how I would like it and I prefer not to be one of those \"Can I get the bacon cheeseburger, no cheese, no bacon?\" kind of people. So I got the double cheeseburger, sans the double. The best way to judge a restaurant, particularly a casual restaurant, is to have the burger. If they can make a good burger, then I can confidently order from the rest of the menu. P.U.B. did not disappoint. The burger was delicious; seasoned properly and cooked to perfection. Despite being over-sized, the bun was awesome. To top it all off, the seasoned skinny fries were fantastic. \n\nOnce the beer, burger, and fries were gone, it was time. Bring on the PBR. Let's just say, you get what you pay for. Who says you can't buy anything for a nickel anymore? One nickel can buy you a plastic cup filled with the beer that has been an American icon and beloved by Midwesterners for decades. May not have lived up to my Kronenbourg 1664, but it made for good times. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience at Todd English P.U.B. The prices were typical Las Vegas Strip prices and apparently low for City Center. The staff still had that \"I don't know what I am doing\" attitude, but our waiter was decent. I can't say that you'll be able to find me there every Tuesday night, but I'm sure that was not my last visit. If you want some slightly overpriced, slightly better-than-expected burgers, and nickel PBR, Todd English P.U.B. is what you want.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

My lady got a Firestone double jack and I ordered the parabola bottle. Needless to say the beers were great. Our bartender asked us if we wanted any happy hour foods, we told her to just let us know when the kitchen was going to close in case we got hungry. She was probably one of the happier of the bunch. I think her name was Brenda? Either way she made us feel super confortable with all the tention going on behind the bar.

I stayed at Aria a few years ago, but hadn't been back since so I decided to walk over and see what is new or had changed in that time.  It was around dinner and I was wander around the reception area and I spotted a restaurant that looked relaxed and casual in the far right corner.  This happened to be Todd English Pub, and is the place I decided to have dinner Sunday night.\n\nI entered Todd English Pub around 8pm and the place was packed.  You needed reservations for a table, but since it was just me, I sat at the bar.  I was quickly greeted and given a menu by my server.  I checked out the drink menu and was thrilled to see that they had Strongbow Cider on the menu, so I quickly ordered one.  Price for the cider was $11 per glass, but I love cider so it worth it.  \n\nI perused the menu for a while, not sure if I should order a Pub meal like Sheppard's Pie or a burger.  I finally made up my mind and went with Chicken Tacos ($16), the description made them sound flavorful and delicious and didn't let me down.  The chicken tacos come 3 to an order with a crock or rice and beans.  The shells were good; soft shells and held up well against the moist chicken meat and salsa.  The chicken was so moist and well seasoned, I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it and could have eaten even more.  The rice and beans were presented mixed in a crock and were good with a bit of spice as well.   After two glasses of cider and the tacos, my bill totaled $41.  A bit steep, but it's LV so not too bad comparatively.\n\nThe service at the bar was great.  I wish I would have gotten my servers name, but he was attentive and quick to make sure I had what I needed.  \n\nI will definitely be coming here again in the near future.

After looking at several options for holding an informal reception, we came across the PUB.  Obviously being from out of town, and not being able to actually see\/experience the venue beforehand, was a big concern.  Upon our arrival we decided to stop by and see what the place was like.  As you may imagine the place is typically \"English Pub\" décor, but with the added grandiose Vegas touch (exceptionally well kept, clean, and omitting the dark\/grubby British aspects, not a bad thing).  The General Manager, John Lanata, graciously met with us and spent a great deal of his time providing assistance and making sure that all of our questions were answered.  He also invited us to try the menu for lunch, to which we were not disappointed.  I ordered the Lobster rolls while my wife requested the daily special, a Turkey club.  Both items were absolutely exceptional (see attached).  I am a huge lobster fan and this did not disappoint.  There was plenty of meat, butter, and seasoned just right, complementing and not obscuring one of natures more subtle flavors.  My wife's selection was also exceptional (see attached) moist and tender, with smoked bacon that was pretty amazing.  \n\nThe bar has an great selection of beer, wine, and hard-spirits, particularly Bourbon (many of which have been personally selected from small Distiller's that I never even knew existed).  \n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of our visit were the people working there... Everyone was polite, friendly, and ready to help (Exactly as it should be in Vegas).  Mr. Lanata, was obviously involved with his staff and took the time to speak with them often.\n\nFor our Reception, We had the game-area set-aside for our guests with Hors D'oeuvres, Well- , beer, and wine drinks.  The game area also has self-serve draught-beer handles, which several of our guest enjoyed.  This small area was perfect for us as it easily held our small party (~25 persons) on an intimate level, but at the same-time keeping us within the public atmosphere of room.  It was a really nice casual setting, perfect for our needs.  The wait-staff were extremely attentive, providing us  with plenty of Hors D'oeuvres and drinks at all times.  All of the Hors D'oeuvres were fantastic (Pot Stickers, Ahi-Tuna, Shrimp Skewers, Sliders, and Brie and Bacon sandwiches)  Overall, if you are looking for a fun, casual setting in Vegas you would be hard-pressed to do better!\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Mr. Lanata and his staff.

How about:  \"the stuff we drank in college because it was only $2.\"  Now that's an accurate description, and I wouldn't have to pay $9 for it.\n\nTo their credit, if you go after 10, beers are half price--so you'll end up paying what a beer actually should cost. \n\nWe ordered some wings, because, after all, every good pub has good wings.  Ten minutes later, a server walked past our table with a plate of wings--no reason for us to believe they were specifically ours--and he started arguing with other servers. After a couple of minutes, he threw the wings down on the table next to ours and said, \"congrats, you got free wings.\"  Another server then asked us, \"did you guys order wings?\" \"Yes, we did,\" we replied.  At this point, the guy picks up the wings from the table he had just given them to \"for free,\" mutters something about us, and throws the plate down on our table.

We got to the PUB around 2 to enjoy a late lunch. The restaurant still had a fair amount of energy even though it was about 30% occupied. \n\nNow to the food. We had difficulty deciding on our meal as many items on the menu looked appealing. I opted for the lobster rolls with house made chips and my wife ordered Grichebactom (grilled cheese with brie an bacon) and mac and cheese. The lobster rolls were incredible. A warm buttery roll with the richness of the lobster were a perfect match. My wife's Grichebactom was good, but not great. We couldn't help ourselves and ordered desserts. I took down the bread pudding topped with salted caramel ice cream and caramel sauce while my wife ordered the chocolate cream pie topped with toasted marshmallows. The desserts were definitely a 10 out of 10. \n\nWe were pleased enough with our first meal that we decided to go back for round 2. I ordered the dirty chips (topped with blue cheese, bacon and fried chicken livers) and duck buns, while the wife ordered the sliders. The dirty chips were amazing. I didn't know what to expect with the fried chicken livers and they were cooked perfectly. This was a delicious combination of salty, creamy, crunch and richness. The duck buns were ok. As I dug into the chips first, the juice from the duck made the buns soggy which was not the greatest mouthfeel.  This was not the foods fault, but mine for taking my time. My wife's sliders were tasty, but nothing extraordinary. We opted not to partake in dessert on this visit. I will be visiting the Todd English PUB on my next trip to Vegas.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We've been wanting to try Todd English for over a year so we decide to meet up there. \nI walk in and stand for at least 5 minutes without a hostess being at the front. Eventually both hostess come back together and I am not joking both ignore me as I am standing 2 feet away, with a line behind me. Thankfully the (executive?) chef comes by and all of the sudden the hostess see I'm standing. We are then seated. \n\nUpon examining the beer list on the menu\/chalkboards we still have a few questions so when our waitress comes by we ask her about the \"trappists\" beers they carry. The menu just says Rochefort, and I ask her which of the Rochefort's she carries but she has no idea. After checking she comes back and tells us it's the Rochefort \"8\" (which by the way is the worst of the three that the brewery makes, why would you carry that one). So we decide on Dechutes The Abyss instead. For some reason she only rudely asks for my ID, even though my friends and I are all the same age, watch out ABC. 5 Minutes later she comes back and informs us that they are all out of the Abyss...of course...  Since the rest of their beer list is very boring and unoriginal I'm forced to order an Arrogant Bastard. My friends order their beers and she runs away as I am trying to order Appetizers. I flag her down and order some sliders and pretzels. Our beers come out and I immediately know that beer I ordered is wrong. Its much much darker than it is supposed to be and tastes nothing like the Arrogant Bastard. I try to find my waitress but to no avail. So i set my beer on the edge of the table, fully untouched, but she ignores it. A food runner drops off our \"toasted\"pretzels and they are stone cold. Worse than any pretzel I have ever had in my life. I place our untouched pretzels with the beer at the edge of the table praying to God someone will take them away from us. But of course they never do, and I am forced to sit staring at them.\n\nThe sliders and fries were actually pretty good, but they use Heinz ketchup, which is a big no-no for any gastropub. \n\nAs we sit hungry and thirsty we decide that our dinner will have to take place somewhere else. Its easily an hour since we walked into the Pub and our waitress hasn't taken our entree order.  She then comes by and asks us how everything is, when there is 3 untouched beers and the pretzels at the end of the table. We simply ask for the check and she leaves without saying a word. She then brings the bill and drops it off without a word. With our dishes still waiting to be taken away. We pay the bill and leave.\n\nI will never return to this place even though I love the concept and am in Vegas all the time. This is an extremely poor rendition of a gastropub. Hire some employees that actually care about what they are doing. Don't brag about \"you don't carry bad beers like bud\" when you actually DO carry terrible beers that are just as widely distributed as bud. I would not describe them as a craft beer bar.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I've been here several times at different times of day and prefer their lunch the most. There are just too many places to drink and eat dinner to recommend this place after happy hour. I like the decor and the staff is pretty good-- I will say that with loads of hard surfaces (tile everywhere), it does get very loud even at only half capacity. There is also a large bell that rings frequently, so if you aren't into that, go elsewhere. \n\nDrinks are plentiful any time of day. I've only had the beer and was pleasantly surprised by the selection. Their Bloody Mary bar looks sort of overwrought, but it doesn't necessarily look bad. It might be sort of fun if you are into vegetable juice cocktails (I am not). \n\nThe fish and chips are good, and traditional in style. That means you should be dousing them in malt vinegar and saving the ketchup for your fries. Please do not be the jerk I saw one time dipping his fish in ketchup and complaining that they we're not like fish sticks-- it's embarrassing. Keep in mind that portion sizes are large here, so it may be a good idea to split these or any dish with a friend. \n\nI went into my last visit here expecting to write a four star review, but have to revise it downward. Yesterday for lunch I had the the CBLT which was not spectacular. It was sort of soggy and strange, although I appreciated the heft of it. I'll return to the fish and chips next time.

Not only with the food being below average but with the terrible service (not the whole staff, our server specifically, Nicole I believe was her name). We made reservations, as we were a large party celebrating my sister's birthday. The server kept pushing a round of shots for the birthday girl after we turned them down 3 times, we finally agreed- (yes a whole 11 dollars a pop for  a group of 13!)\n\nShe then tried to up the sales again by mentioning that our food would take longer since we were large party so we should get appetizers. Why would you announce that you are incapable of providing for a large party effectively? And it's not really true that appetizers are quicker than entrees. \n\nShe then brought out a birthday cake and sang to my sister even though no one requested this or ordered it, and then put a $9 charge for the cake we never ordered!\n\nThe ultimate worst part of it all, was the way she handled our check. I've been a server for 5 years and I know what a pain in the @$$ it is to split a check a million times when you are busy and no one tips right and its a huge old mess. However, under the circumstance that the bill is close to a thousand bucks, I really can't imagine why anyone would want to max out their card in vegas. Especially since it was not very busy, there is no reason to make a big fuss. We had mostly cash and 3 credit cards. This is easy enough. I've done it a million times for checks that are not even half that amount. Yeah it sucks, but you do it b\/c you get an automatic gratuity even if you are an awful server.\n\nShe complained over and over about how she couldn't do it and how the bartender had to do it and how they don't like to do it, and how its so complicated.... give me a break! You swipe the card, type in the amount, rip it out of the printer, and stick a pen in the book! If you have other things to take care of, politely state \"I would be happy to do this for you, but we are busy with other guests so please keep in mind that this may take up to 15 minutes, is that okay with you?\"  \n\nYou really think we're gonna tip over the auto-grat when you do not want to do your job?

For those of you looking, the restaurant is right outside Aria going into the city center.  \n\nMy group was participating in an event all day which prevented us from making the trip to the PUB in the morning.  Our goal was the bloody mary and when we arrived there around 11 pm at night...extremely hungry...we were told that the bloody mary's were for brunch only.  I pleaded with them and they kindly made us a round.  They were amazing and we loved them.  \n\nThe rest of the food was good, our waitress was pleasant.  The restaurant had a great atmosphere.  Here is a tip...bring a dollar to the bathroom as there is a bathroom attendant who is quick to squirt soap on your hands when you leave the water closet.  She deserves a tip just for sitting next to the bathroom at the back of the restaurant let alone giving you good smelling soap and a towel.\n\nWe will most certainly return to this restaurant now that we know where it is.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The massive billboards with famous faces and \"world renowned\" emblazoned everywhere leads the uninitiated to believe that there's something special hidden behind these giant glass windows.  I had \"meh\" expectations walking in, and I wasn't far off. \n\nTodd English P.U.B. is conveniently located only yards from the front desk of the Aria hotel in the middle of the strip, and makes its presence known to anyone checking in or out of the resort.  Billing itself as an excellent place for craft beers, and considering its close proximity to my room, I decided to go there at the recommendation of the man checking me in.  \n\nA slow sunday evening meant quick seating at a large booth near the bar, and relatively quick service from a friendly guy named \"Cory\".  Lighting was a problem.  There wasn't nearly enough of it, especially for the 7 o'clock sunday dinner crowd.  Using the light from my cell phone I discovered that the beer menu is rather long, which is nice, but is on the pricey side if you want to drink a lot.  The food seemed appealing, especially given the enthusiasm with which Cory suggested the fish and chips meal.  I settled in, preparing myself for greasy and salty post flight recovery food.\n\nThe food arrived so quickly it left me and my companion wondering if they had a stack of them waiting for someone to order.  Seriously no more than 10 minutes elapsed between the words \"Fish and Chips\" leaving my mouth, and that same fish\/chip dish entering my stomach.  \n\nThe portions were a bit off.  Only 2 pieces of fish about the size of a deck of cards, accompanied by a mountain of potato wedges that must have weighed 3 pounds.  I think I could have done with 50% less potato, and 50% more fish.  The fish was nice, not too heavy or oily, and the breading wasn't mushy or bland.  They also plate this dish on an aluminum pan with a piece of paper beneath it.  Presumably this is to aid in the dishwashing process, but I kept pulling little shreds of damp paper out of my mouth as I ate.  In hindsight I think I would have ordered something different.\n\nIn summary - \nAtmosphere: dimly lit, plenty of space.\nService - Attentive and friendly.\nFood - Points for speedy delivery, but not for portion size or plating.\nDrinks - Varied but pricey.  \n\n2 Meh's for effort.  Would have been 3 if I had gotten 1 more piece of fish to eat.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Also each bar position has a fancy 7 second hour glass attached to the bar. If you can finish your beer in 7 seconds, it is free.  The problem with this is they have a very sophisticated selection of beers and it would be a shame to drink one that fast and not enjoy it.  \nTwo things caught my attention. The Raw Bar and the Carving Station.  Im not a huge raw fish fan but I had a couple of oyster shooters to start off. The selection of raw fish was very good and fresh if you are into that.

So, Friday morning, we got our bets in and headed to find a comfortable place to get something to eat and watch some games. Walking around, we ended up at Todd English P.U.B., which had everything we wanted; seats at the bar, breakfast options, and TVs showing the games. This was one spot, I was glad we stopped in, I had one of the best bloody mary's, ever, spicy, with the right mix of vodka (Hangar One) and tomato juice and the perfect garnish of pickled carrot and a block of cheddar cheese with some pickled string beans, all with a salt and peppered rim. Delightful. One of those babies and that's all I needed for the afternoon.  Breakfast was good but a little salty for my taste. There were a few brunch options, I got the bacon, egg, cheese sandwich (bacon on the side) and Gramercy Guy had the English breakfast, fried eggs, bacon, toast and beans. These beans were the show stealer. I traded my bacon for the beans and thinking about them now is making my mouth water. There was meat (I was told from the bar tender, it's what's ever left on the cutting board) with the right balance of smoky (probably from the meat) and sweet. Had I known how good the beans were, I would have swapped the fries I barely touched for more beans. And you know what they say about beans being for the heart. So really this was a perfectly balanced meal between the beans and the tomato juice.\n\nThe cool thing about Todd English P.U.B. is their drink challenge. Along the bar, there are many hour glasses that flip; they are timed for 7 seconds. The challenge: if you can drink a pint of beer before the time runs out, it's free. I knew I wasn't up for the challenge but watched many people around me do it, some more than once. Matt, the bartender, guessed that about 80% of the people who try actually succeed.\n\nTo see pictures and read more go to http:\/\/gramercygirl.blogspot.com\/2012\/03\/todd-english-pub.html","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They have a great beer selection (draught), not your typical American crap lagers. This was the first place I tried Innis and Gunn (a Scottish beer) and they served it at the perfect temperature. Of all the other places I've had it, no one comes close to serving it right. \n\nThe happy hour prices are awesome: 50% off draught beers. Prices are otherwise high (lots of draughts start at $12+), but, as previously mentioned, they are good beers (lots of craft and European beers). You also get to sample their draught beers, so you don't have to blindly commit to a random beer you may not like. I have only sat at the bar, so I have never eaten food here. I can't comment on the food, but it appears their raw seafood bar is popular. \n\nThe service at the bar has always been the same. Every time we go (my gf and I) our bartender will take a while to actually serve us (not too long, but longer than expected with the number of patrons that are present) and they won't be too talkative. However, the longer we stay the nicer they get. They are very informative on their beers and offer samples to the beers we are interested in trying. We have not met one bad bartender and we, honestly, have loved each bartender that has helped us. In fact, even the dishwasher at the bar was informative and very helpful as well. \n\nThe only reason I give this place -1 star is for the price outside of happy hour. I understand it's Vegas and it's located within their high-end mall, but the prices are still extravagant. The PUB at Monte Carlo next door has a great selection of beers also, but they are not nearly as expensive. Regardless, this is a great establishment with great beer and wonderful service. I would recommend this place to anyone and have made this a place that I will frequent anytime I'm in Vegas.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

For an Eastcoaster such as myself, this was a great opportunity to get stuff like Black Butte on draft. For those visiting without renting a vehicle, this would also be a good opportunity to get their craft drink on right on the strip, unless they want to be sipping sugary drinkie poos from over-sized plastic sippy cups.\nThe ambiance is also superior to most L. Vegas bars. The lighting was very cozy, the bar was an oval in the center of the room, with multiple bartenders tending to ones needs. A game of sports was being televised on television sets placed all around the joint.\nNow for the prices- most stuff was in the neighborhood of $8-$10. I understand that for Las Vegas this is a very niche business, though one on the rise, and the rent must be higher than Charlie Sheen, but other places we visited were able to offer somewhat lower prices.\nNot being huge gamblers, what me and my wife did was play some slots at Aria, than upon winning $30-$40, we would proceed to this P.U.B. and blow our winnings. Repeat as many times as necessary.\n\nNote for guests staying at Aria: the in room fridges have weight sensors. I did what I do everywhere else in the world- take the contents out neatly, place own purchases(gallon of water, as we're in the dessert, beers), and before checking out- place everything back in in the same order. We received a bill of around $50 for mini fridge charges. They said they would investigate, but it took us many calls to the managers to get this fee reversed...lesson learned- don't every do anything, anywhere lol","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The bloody mary is a meal to itself.  We've enjoyed their fish and chips, sandwiches, oysters and most especially their lobster roll.  But during our most recent trip two weeks ago, we learned that Todd English got greedy with their bottom line.  The lobster roll price was raised to $29 but got stingy with the amount of lobster in their roll.  It used to be that the delicious buttery bread had a pocket for the lobster to fill.  They changed that; the bread pocket is no more and the lobster just lies on top of the bread.

After seeing the menu on the outside of the door, we were anxious to see if the food was as good as it sounded. \n\nOn first approach, the hostess was extremely pleasant and very kind. She sat us immediately at a booth along the wall. Our waitress, I think her name was Hayleigh, came to our table to take our drink order and my fiance and I both ordered drinks from the bar. I ordered the white sangria and he ordered a Manhattan. Our drinks took approximately 20 minutes to come to the table and when the server brought them out to the table, she made an excuse about the bartender being new and walked away. This did not bother us much except for the fact that we probably would have ordered 2nd drinks if they had not taken so long! \nBefore she brought the drinks, the server asked if we were ready to order and seemed inconvenienced when I mentioned that we would like to order an appetizer. However, we ordered the mussels and they were really delicious. Our food came out before we were finished with the appetizer. I ordered the Lobster Rolls and my fiance ordered the RIbeye. My Lobster Rolls were delicious. i cannot express how much I loved them. Definitely a must try if you happen to want to try this place out. My fiance's ribeye was cooked well, however the potato wedges that came with it were cold and soggy. By this time, both of our waters have been empty for a good 15 minutes. Once we finally got our servers attention, she was annoyed when we explained to here that the wedges were cold.\nDuring this time, the table in front of us was complaining to the manager about their food taking a long time, and the manager was a complete jerk about it to them. Both my fiance and I are servers and we have never witnessed worse customer service. The manager was rude and condescending and told the table that they were lying about their food taking a long time, and said \"What do you want me to do about it?\" \nFor this reason, we chose not to speak with the manager because of how rude we saw him being. We then asked our server, who we have seen only 3 times all night to box up our food, because we just wanted to leave. \n\nWorst service I have ever experienced. I will never go back. I cannot believe a place with this reputation allows their management to treat customers so badly. My fiance and I have friends who live in Las Vegas and we travel here at least once a year.

Enough times that many of the bar staff recognize us. Unfortunately, on our last visit, we had another bad experience. About halfway through our first beers, we ordered an early dinner. An hour later, after more beer, we still hadn't received any food. We felt we couldn't wait any longer, and closed our tab. We needed food to offset the alcohol. Not sure whose fault this was. Again, the bar staff was (mostly) attentive. We understand there has been a big turnover lately. New ownership. Anyway.. don't know if the food is still good.

For the rest? I walked away both unhappy and queasy.\n\nStart with the beer: we visited PUB right after it opened and left without ordering because they were out of my first three beer picks. Tonight? Same story. Also could not make the first two mixed drinks my husband requested, but finally managed a vodka tonic.\n\nI ordered roast beef sliders. The roast beef was just ok, but the bread was dry, hard and cold. I also ordered a side of fries, which were served dead cold. Our server did go and get a new, hot order without argument, then brought me a bottle of ketchup (which you have to ask for because only plebes want ketchup?) absolutely crusted with old, hard ketchup.\n\nThe last straw was the drunk guy who decided to sit at our table for a chat. After I chased him off, the waiter came over and commented on it. After. Thanks. In a 1\/4 full restaurant, I'd love a little more monitoring from staff.\n\nI'm sorry that I didn't take the time to ask for the manager and complain, but I really wanted to be on vacation. If you're also on vacation, choose NobHill (MGM) or Sensei (Bellagio) or even Todd English Olives (Caesars) for MUCH better food, and the same unexciting beer selection that you eventually discover is available at PUB.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Todd English has been one of my absolute favorite restaurants in town for years, however they apparently changed chefs or management recently that have turned mine & my husbands once LOVED dishes into a pale comparison of their former selves. \n\nI cannot even tell you what number visit this was to TE, but I can say we've never experienced service as poor as last night. \n\nTo start off we walked in & ask for a table for 2 outside. She seated us at a 2 top against the wall. It was pretty cramped so I went back in & asked if we could please move to 1 of the bigger (empty & dirty) tables once they were cleaned off. She said, \"tell your server\", turned her back to me & returned to her conversation w\/ the other hostess. Hmm.  Ok, I let that one go, told our server and he moved us. \n\nNow we are getting to the sad stuff. It was 9:56pm. (According to the receipt.) We had intentions of ordering the Happy Hour chicken wings we love so much & as an appetizer the Fried Bologna Sandwich.  The waiter informed us it wasn't HH yet. I wasn't aware of the time, so didn't know we were mere minutes away, & agreed to an order of 3 wings. I expressed that we like them \"plain\", possibly my mistake for not expressing, \"no sauce\". So when they came out they needed to be sent back. Upon their original arrival though I discovered those are not the wings I've come to know & love. They are now a double jointed wing, which thankfully still tastes the same, but became change #1!  \n\nNext the Fried Bologna Sandwich came, I thought to myself, WTH is this!  Their once incredible sandwich has been down graded to nothing more than a deli sandwich you can get at any old chain. I asked when they changed it and the waiter told me it has always been that way with a look on his face that said, \"I don't know what you're talking about, but that's the same!\"  I decided to check if anyone ever posted a picture of the old sandwich to Yelp to verify I was not going crazy. Thankfully, I found a picture, but just let it go and made a mental note to never order that item again.\n\nAt this point, because I know I'm not crazy and I've already seen 2 very significant changes to dishes that are not even mentioned on the menu, (which btw looks exactly the same as it always has,) I decided it was time to ask what other changes had been made & if my favorite dish, the lobster rolls were the same. He said yes they are the same, & I unfortunately blindly trusted the employee over my gut instinct.  \n\nMy husband ordered his usual Prime Beef Carvery, which now comes served on a dissolving paper that almost ended up in his mouth because the meat is now served drenched in jus. Another change that rendered the dish inedible by my husband.  Not to mention, the beef itself was a sad substitute for the large, hefty slices he has always gotten in the past!\n\nOnto the lobster rolls. Thankfully not much here other than smaller size rolls and a little too much mayo used in the mix, but that could have been a 1 batch thing, I don't hold that against them as a restaurant. \n\nWhen the waiter came over and asked how everything was, we were completely honest and expressed all our displeasure, most notably my husband's dish, the gravy or sauce or whatever was on his dish that made it inedible for him and turned the decorative paper into a part of the meal. The waiter again said nothing had changed with that dish, but finally agreed to go ask his chef.  \n\nWell well well, what do you know, I was right about every single change I had addressed and the waiter denied. While I do respect the waiter for finally telling us the truth, it is extremely disappointing it took an entire displeasing meal and us pushing him to do so!  He informed us everything has been changed because they have a new chef and asked what he could do to make it up to us. Unfortunately the only thing that can make any of this better is to go back to the AMAZING Todd English PUB I loved so much. \n\nI'd also like to make note that at no point did a manager come over to express his apologies or anything!  Not good  especially when you have 2 locals who would frequently drive to the strip solely to eat at your restaurant!  The only thing that was done to make up for the regrettable meal was my husband's dish was taken off the bill. \n\nWhen seated the waiter asked if we have dined there before and we confirmed we had. It was at this point he should have told us there were recent changes to their menu. (I guess that maybe would have happened had he actually known there were changes.)\n\nAs for why I decided to give 1 star even though some of the food was edible is because upon leaving it occurred to me, the sad reality is that wasn't just a bad night in the kitchen that could be rectified...  This is how their food is now permanently. There will be no going back to the TE. Pub we loved.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":0}

The entrees were also p[ricey- I paid $17 for a grilled cheese and fries.  The food was OK, but not worth the money.  Then, to top it off, when we asked for the check, he gave us 1 check with 20% gratuity added.  We reminded him about separating it.  He then went back to his register and took about 20 minutes to slpit everything up and process our payments.  YES, I understand that splitting checks is a pain, but honestly, it's more and more common these days, especially in a tourist area like Vegas.

Half inch squares pieces of vegetables on a cocktail skewer. A one biter. We couldn't discern any vegetable aside from the red onion. Two large olives would have been more filling. We had the roasted chicken and TE brisket. Flavorful, but portions were very small for a large group. Only enough brisket for about a half of cup each. Chicken a little more. Sauces were good. More than enough for the meat we had. Mac and cheese was average. Grilled asparagus was good. Again the portions were kind of stingy for the size of the group. I'm guessing we were to fill up on french fries and fried pickles so more satisfying portions would not be missed.

They serve you free popcorn but when I told the guy who brought it that I was ok on having it he just turned and walked away. I was just trying to save you a wasted bucket of popcorn. Incentive was the free corona light. I would like to continue coming here when in town but the service has got to get better.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Well this is why not: the food was ridiculously overpriced, carelessly made and couldn't hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost. My $20 plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back, when it came back the flavor wasn't even up to Costco's high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce. I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was $87 before the tip!! $20 for one beer flight of four tiny tastes? Really?

They both basically said is there something you would like me to do? If I knew my company made a mistake I would just correct it ink stead of asking the customer to ask me to correct it. Maybe comp the salad? So I let it go, then I decided a few hours later to call and complain, because the bill was $125 for three people for lunch with one drink.... So I talked to the manager tonight who basically asked for the servers name, didn't really address the fact that my salad was complete trash ($25 salad).

Looking around, they seem to have the raw bar in the middle with the small, slightly darker and more pub-like room on the side, an outdoor patio on the other side, and a more well lit dining room in the back.  There's a mix of polished cement, tile, and wood throughout.  It's modern yet still warm.\n\nThe beer menu here is fantastic.  It's not as extensive as some places, but they have a great variety of quality beers with excellent descriptions.  I had the Wexford Irish Cream.  For those who love cream ales and rue the day that Caffrey's was bought out by Coors who stopped importing it to the US, then Wexford is probably the closest thing you'll find.\n\nThe food here is good too.  Not the most amazing food in the world, but very tasty.  We shared a bunch of plates:\n-- Caesar salad: Pretty standard.  Very good croutons.\n-- Grilled soft mini pretzels.  These are about the size of a long cigars.\n-- Corn dog puppies.  I'm not usually a fan of corn dogs, but these were fantastic.  Amazing, light, yet tasty breading.  They came with skinny fries which were unremarkable.\n-- Kelley's roast beef sliders.  KM asked for them without wiz, which made them a bit dry.  Passable, but average.\n-- Chicken parm sliders.  Just how chicken parm should be but on a small bun.  Good stuff.\n-- Man of steel burger.  Cooked just right.

We started with the Dirty Chips, which were amazing upscale nachos thing with house made potato chips, cheese and a whole bunch of awesome on the side.\n\nThe middle portion of their menu is the \"Carving Board\".  It's a great selection of house cured meats and you choose a bread and two sauces - basically make your own awesome sandwich.  I got the brisket with sourdough bread, truffled aioli and pineapple teriyaki sauce.  The teri sauce was awesome and I really liked the dish, definitely getting a different version of the carving board.\n\nDefinitely be stopping by next time we visit Vegas, and this could easily be up to 5 stars pretty easy.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

That goes for ingredients, to cookware, to restaurants. If the name wasn't there, would it be just as good? Well, the Todd English P.U.B. (even the name irks me.

We got seats on a Saturday night with very little wait. The place is spacious and bustling. Restaurants in Vegas don't have the selection of beer I come to expect in my home town, but here, the selection is respectable. Lots of things on tap, both imports (Belgian, German, English, etc.) and American microbrews (and they even have a cask ale, which is hard to find) . \n\nHere's a summary of what we tried: \n\nRaw oysters - fresh and delicious, just like in California.\n\nDirty Chips - GET THIS! Unsure what sick mind came up with it, but it was delicious as an appetizer.\n\nDuck Confit from the carvery - Delicious. The maple soy sounded a bit suspect, but the savory\/sweetness worked well with the duck. Use sparingly though, it's a bit concentrated. All you need is a dab. The other sauce that we ordered was the black truffle mayo. As other reviewers rave, it is awesome. Try dipping fries in it!\n\nSheperds Pie - meat and potatoes in a cast iron dish, how can you go wrong? Delicious.\n\nThe portions are plenty large, so bring an appetite. The prices are what you'd expect from a restaurant on the strip, but relatively speaking, it was worth the price.

I love the atmosphere and my service has always been top notch - especially tonight (keep reading)\n\nTonight I went with my fiancé and her family.  Our servers were very friendly and everybody had a great time.  The staff was nice enough to modify some of our meals - like a special salad for my fiancé and off-menu greens with my steak.  The mussels are so good, especially the sauce - I found myself almost drinking the tomato sauce with a spoon.  Others tried the thick slices of pastrami and loved it.  The shrimp, sold by the piece, is perfect.  My ribeye was a thin cut, pub style.  It was tasty although I prefer a good filet over a ribeye any day.\n\nInteresting thing happened:  My shrimp came and I grabbed the lemon - something thick and black on the lemon made a dark stain on my finger!  Smelled like grease or rubber.  The staff was quick to apologize and take it back to the manager.  I went to the nice bathroom (complete with attendant) and wash my hand.  When I came back, they had given me a fresh batch of shrimp and a couple of extras!  The manager came by and apologized again and was very nice to everyone.  I was impressed because a simple sorry would have been enough for me, but they made sure we were taken care of.  \n\nFinally, we briefly mentioned that we were getting married in several months.  At the end of our meal, out of nowhere, a couple of lit candles and some ice cream cookie sandwiches appeared on our table.  Nice touch.\n\nThe menu has so many different choices, I could come back 10 times and try something different every time.

The Todd English Pub was the first restaurant we came across as we exited the Aria so we decided to give it a try. In hindsight, I wish we'd done a bit more research and kept looking. \n\nI know we're in Vegas and prices are ridiculously jacked up but a $70+ lunch for two people is insane. There was nothing special enough about this food to warrant such a high price tag. I ordered the Prime Rotisserie sandwich, which was basically a fancy name for French dip. For $20, it shockingly came with a side of fries too. I debated for quite awhile whether I should order a $20 sandwich, as it basically goes against everything I believe, but everything else on the menu was similarly overpriced. The sandwich tasted fine but it was too much for me to eat in one meal. It's too bad that they don't offer half sandwich offers, especially considering that most people are on vacation and likely don't have a place to store leftovers. Instead, I had to toss part of my expensive sandwich away.\n\nMy boyfriend chose the Caesar salad, which even without meat still costs $14 and is at least an additional $8 depending on the type of meat you want to add. He then also added an order of waffle fries for an extra $9. For a side of fries!!!  Honestly, I wish we would have just ordered the waffle fries and called it a day. The fries were delicious albeit in no way worth $9 but at least it would have made our lunch less pricey overall.  The ranch here is way too dilly and definitely does not taste like regular ranch. I was quite disappointed in it and I'm a huge restaurant ranch fan.\n\nTo get the weekend started, my boyfriend also ordered a beer. Guess how much that cost? $14 for one beer! As is the theme of this review, that's crazy! In fact, it was so crazy that he only ordered the one beer and I'm not sure when is the last time I've seen him stick to one beer at a restaurant. \n\nI'd be willing to offer four stars for the food if the prices weren't so high but the quality just doesn't match the price tag as is. Although the complimentary popcorn was a nice touch, it wasn't worth $70.","useful":6,"funny":2,"cool":4}

We asked a server in the area if it was ok if we sat ourselves thinking he could just send a hostess out with menus - he gave us a shitty look and told us no way. Jerk. \n\nSo back to the food - we tried the roast beef sliders, chicken wings and chips. The first order of sliders we received came out COLD. Nothing like biting into cold beef, bun and Whiz sauce to make your stomach turn. My hubs had the wings which were kind of mushy, and very mediocre. By far the best dish was the chips which we ordered with curry sauce even though it wasn't offered as an option on the menu. This is something that I would recommend, although I have a hard time with any pub that doesn't regularly offer chips and curry - even a gastropub should get that one right. And no HP sauce. I mean, seriously???!\n\nThe beer selection was pretty poor for a pub as well. When I think pub, I think selection and variety is key. And by variety, I don't mean Stella and PBR. \n\nThe only reason why I will award PUB that second star is because our server was very sweet and quickly replaced my cold sliders, requested our special curry sauce, and generally tried to take care of us despite the lackluster food and beverage offerings. \n\nPass on PUB.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I then needed to grab a quick dinner before heading back to expo activities, so I thought I'd try out Todd's place since I was one of his first ever clients who would rush from work to stand in line in Charlestown awaiting for the door to open at his first Olive's restaurant. Well.....\nI arrived alone to dine, was taken to a table quickly outside and after a previous night's party with open bar, didn't think I was up to having anything but water. I think the fact that I was alone and wasn't going to be running up a big bar bill was a bummer for the server. She pretty much started ignoring me. Like , right past me to take an order of a full 4 top. Even the couple at the next table looked at me and remarked how she was not serving me. I was getting late and it was actually embarrassing. So, I got up and went inside and spoke to the manager about it. \nHe was very good about quickly reseating me (although then I had attitude from another server in there about taking that table!l Lots of server attitudes there?!) \nBut, the manager took my order quickly, brought it out himself, then comped it all.  This is how a restaurant should handle mishaps, if they do occur.  But, why oh why did it have to even happen?! Geez, snooty server; not everyone has a full group with them and not everyone drinks expensive drinks; so sorry!  But; I DO tip extremely well when it's deserved. \nSo....the food: be hungry. Big servings! I had the wedge salad, which was really good. It was so big though, that I was too full to eat much of my entree. It is really big enough to be a main course, unless you are a big dude with a huge appetite. I also had the tuna burger. It was very good, but I only ate half of it. \nOverall, It was a fun place and I would go back. The outside area, where I actually wanted to sit, is really nice. Inside, a fun louder area. Thank you to the manager for his handling of this unfortunate occurrence. I hope that server finds another job because she doesn't seem to embody the values that Todd has set out from the beginning of his restaurants.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I was impressed with Todd English's food at the LA Food & Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one (even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare).\n\nThe atmosphere was very raucous.  It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.  There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps (unfortunately, since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area, you have to deal with several smokers nearby).\n\nThe menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash.\n\nWe started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, which was the best dish of the night.  While expensive, the starter was good.  The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette.  The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons.  The tuna was fresh.  It was also quite spicy.\n\nI also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.\n\nI tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.\n\nService was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).\n\nPrices were not too bad for Las Vegas.  There were several entrees below $20.  However, for the quality of food, you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices.\n\nThough we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better.  I did like the little sampling of Todd English's food at the LA event (and he is a very charming, funny and smart guy), but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen.\n\nTodd English PUB is located right next to Aria.  Aria has its own free parking structure and it is easy to find a space (valet parking is also available).","useful":19,"funny":12,"cool":13}

As for the main course the lobster rolls were a disappointment. The meat tasted like it had been sitting for a while and though drenched in brown butter it was missing taste and the portions were small. We split the second pint. The beer selection is good but the prices are high. So for 2 people without a significant amount of food or drinks we ended up paying over 1$$ which is ridiculous for a pub. I guess I am one of the few people who doesn't like gastro pub craze that's sweeping the nation. If the food is done right and a portions are fulfilling I would have no complaints but just jacking up the price while serving mediocre fusion food is unacceptable.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This place is a gimmick. But that's to be expected when visiting an \"English Pub\" in a casino. Let's get to the pro's and con's.\n\nPro's: the grilled brie and bacon sandwich was very good. My wife's grilled chicken with avocado sandwich also looked very good. Come to think of it, every meal I saw pass us looked very decent.\n\nCon's: No getting around it, the place is supremely over-priced. Typical pint is $11.00. While drinks are expensive in Vegas, this is at the upper-end in terms of cost. Most places in Vegas serve a pint of microbrew for $7.00 to $8.00 (and one place in Palazzo had happy hour pints for $3.00). But you are going to a pub with a large selection of beers, so arguably your premium beer price is going towards having that giant beer selection. \n\nThe service is also leaves a lot to be desired. Our waiter immediately gave us a bad case of the douche chills. I ordered a pint of the cask-conditioned black butte porter and my wife ordered a pint of Magic Hat No. 9. After ordering, he went into this long story about how much he loved Magic Hat No. 9 but wishes he could find it in bottles because in his opinion bottled beer was so much better than draft. According to our waiter, the draft just seemed to \"change the flavor of the beer.\" We thought this was a strange comment because nobody has ever tried to sell me on the idea that bottled beer is better than draft. We didn't think anything of it for the moment.\n\nThen after he brings our beers, my wife sips her beer and comments that this beer is way stronger than Magic Hat No. 9. Magic Hat No. 9 is probably a 5.5% ABV wheat beer. She then let me sip the beer to confirm. Instead of Magic Hat No. 9, the beer was a Belgian Trippel like Chimay White. Personally, I would prefer the Chimay White to a No. 9, but my wife didn't want to start her lunch with a 9% ABV beer and wanted something light like the No. 9. \n\nWhen we explained to the waiter that the beer he brought wasn't No. 9, he tried to convince us that we were wrong. If he had left it at that, we wouldn't have really had a problem because, at the end of the day, we are on vacation, and it's just a beer. We can always grab a beer somewhere else. He then tries to convince that it's the draft mechanism that has changed the flavor. He says that the previous beer on that same tap was a Cider and that the Cider \"residue\" combined with the Magic Hat No. 9 changed its flavor to a Belgian Trippel. Then he starts smiling and says, \"see, I told you that the bottles are better than the tap,\" as if he were bringing his whole bottle full-circle with this experience.\n\nBottom line: We left with the impression that this guy knew they were out of Magic Hat No. 9 but assumed we were too stupid to know the difference between No. 9 and a Belgian Trippel. \n\nBottom line: my lunch was good, but the service was kind of weird. And it's a little bit cheesy, but that is to be expected in Vegas. For the money, there are better offerings on the strip. I prefer the Public House in the Palazzo. Food there is similar in quality (also kind of expensive), but the drinks are a little cheaper.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I ordered the avocado on the side since I'm allergic. OMG. This was sooooooooo good. Although they spread the wasabi aioli on a bit unevenly and I teared up on some bites into my burger, it didn't distract me from the amazing taste and texture of this unique burger. There is a layer of black bean puree that brought everything together. The buns were lightly toasted and the arugula marinated to complement everything else.\n\nBrown butter lobster rolls - came with kettle chips and coleslaw. We split our entrees so I got a whole lobster roll to myself (it comes with three). My goodness, this was one buttery and rich lobster roll. The browned butter is such a genius idea. The lobster pieces were generous and not heavily saturated in mayo. I love how they kept the chunks of lobster big instead of dicing them smaller to make a filler out of mayo. It really kept things fresh and gave me nice chewing action. I tasted the coleslaw and it was pretty good. My mom is not fond of coleslaw, but she polished it off. The chips were just kettle chips, nice crunch, not overly salted.\n\nSERVICE\n\nService was okay. It's what I expected for a bar\/pub type restaurant. Nothing great, nothing bad. I don't like servers to check up on us too often; I don't think she checked up on us at all which can be an issue if I needed something, but didn't.  Definitely try out their tuna burger since this type of burger is rarely on the menu at other restaurants.

Beers from around the world and a healthy variety of small craft brews. I had a couple different ones while I was there and will definitely try more when I go back\n\nHad the duck buns for my appetizer and they were delicious. I realize this kinda contradicts the overall tone of this review that it was nice to have some pub food as duck buns aren't really what you'd expect from a pub, but somehow they fit well. The meat was delicious, well cooked and the buns were great as well. \n\nHad the tacos for my entree and they were superb. Just delicious, nothing like some tacos and beer for a dinner. The tacos had this tasty and creamy but not overly heavy sauce on them which was maybe the best part. All too many places also overload with cabbage and such but that wasn't the case at all at Todd English. \n\nAgain, I think the thing I like most about Todd English is that it was almost like an escape from the Strip, just the overall atmosphere was a pleasant departure. And the food and beer were great. Would definitely go back!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The boyfriend loved his sandwich from the Carvery menu (pastrami) and the pickled veggies that came with.  Big menu with lots to choose from.\n\nThe Bad: Corn Dog Bites that tasted a lot like the samples at Costco.\n\nThe Ugly: Terrible service - from pushing alcohol sales too hard, to not detailing the beers in a flight of beers, to serving the wrong drinks (beer when it was supposed to be cider), to not serving drinks at all and not bringing condiments when requested. Our server was completely indifferent to us, but more than happy to put an auto gratuity of 20% on the bill.  The Fish n Chips which was supposed to be a signature dish was terrible. Two of us ordered it and it was gummy and the breading was too thick and undercooked.  \n\nThe location is great, and in general, I really enjoy Todd English's restaurants, but this one just wasn't what we were hoping for.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

As a whole, I have never been excited about the food here. The service is great, but other than the raw oysters and the fries, nothing really stands out as far as food. My other pet peeve is that they don't really replace their beers when they kick, unless they have another keg of the same beer.

It seems like some places that blend nice and casual fail terribly and some succeed wildly.  I think Todd English PUB does the latter.  From the beer flights to the tile walls to the tv's with sports to the chicken pot pie on the menu, there are real pieces of casual flare everywhere even though it is located where the Aria hotel meets the Crystals shopping area (two of the nicer complexes in Vegas).  But don't let the casualness fool you, the food is not lacking.  The shrimp cocktail is really good and especially the cocktail sauce is amazing.  The beer flights are fun and depending on your taste can be really good.  \n\nI had the ckicken pot pie for dinner and to be fair, I love chicken pot pie almost anywhere I can get it but to also be fair is was really freakin good.\n\nOverall, it is a fun place that IMO takes the best of a casual food atmosphere and blends it with really good food which I love.  I especially love it because all to often I feel like I end up at places that use the casual element on the food prep and make their atmosphere nice but stuffy and thus fail on both sides.\n\nI also love that they serve PBR!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

The chips were smothered in REALLY sharp blue cheese which overpowered the entire dish. The chicken livers that were served with it were fried so much they were nearly burnt. The saving grace of that appetizer were the tomatoes and bacon which tried to cut the sharpness of the blue cheese, but to no avail. The bright side of our appetizer ordering were the raw oysters. They were fresh and the cocktail sauce had the right amount of heat from the horseradish.\n\nNow on to the entrees. I ordered the chicken pot lie and the sauce was a little too salty. The pie top was nice and flaky though. My husband ordered the New Amsterdam and I think that was the best dish of the evening. It is basically a pastrami Reuben with a hamburger. It was delicious! \n\nMy sisters ordered appetizers as entrees. The duck buns had too much hoisin sauce and in the sauteed clam dish my other sister ordered about half of the clam shells were empty! The waitress was kind enough to go to the kitchen and get her more.\n\nOverall I would say it was an okay experience. Many of the items we ordered fell short, but perhaps it really depends on what you order.

I wish I would have been told about the flights of beer, but no matter.\n\nLooking over the menu, the roasted meat selection and bread for sandwiches seemed to be a fun lunch, coupled with an order of skinny and fat fries, and we were off.\n\nWeirdly, chicken on the bone, that was covered in a sweet sauce came out with two pieces of bread, and two very mediocre sauces (BBQ and Miso Soy). My husband had the brisket on a hoagie roll, which was fine, not anything great but decent. Our french fries didn't come out, and when we told the bartender she acted as if she didn't know why they weren't out, instead of just saying she forgot to order them. (which was evident later on our bill)\n\nAfter 15 minutes, my cold skinny fries and husbands fat fries came out hot. Surprisingly at the end of the whole ordeal, we were presented with a check for 44 dollars, without the french fries on the ticket. Ok, fine, I guess the whole thing was just a mediocre lunch, and maybe try again another time.\n\nSurprisingly after we flagged the bartender down to let us pay, we were given our credit card receipt back WITH the fries added after! \n\nAMAZING! It is just another example of a restaurant with no love in the food, a staff who doesn't really care about what they are doing, food that isn't spectacular and its a shame!\n\nI wish I was reporting better news, and I hope that locals and tourists start demanding more from these hotels than just celebrity chefs with restaurants that are sub par.","useful":6,"funny":2,"cool":3}

It's 1200pm and I need food. Grab sunglasses, head is pounding, throw on shorts and flip flops. Quietly shut door and head out. Exit casino left. A walkway, flowing water, fresh air and sun. wow, I needed that; what's this? A pub? Todd English Public Urban Bar (P.U.B.)?? I give it a go - air flowing through out, plenty of seats at the bar. Despite his rumored financial difficulties, this place managed to serve up some pretty sweet food. \n\nStarted off with what I hate to admit was maybe the best bloody mary I've ever had. Pint glass rimmed with spicy Cajun pepper rub. Pickled carrots, onions, celery stalk and plenty of Grey Goose. Well prepared bloody mix, thick and substantial. Outstanding start, particularly when paired with a shot of Patron Silver. Ordered  1\/2 dozen West Coast oysters, somewhere in Washington, bartender wasn't sure exactly where, no problem - they were clean, fresh, meaty and shucked with no damage to meat or shell. Excellent mignonette to accompany these bi-valves. \n\nIn addition, a side of house made pickled veggies - baby carrots, onions, peppers, and pickles. Great pickling job. \n\nFollowed by a free Guinness - actually make that two. You get them free, limit of two, if you can chug it before sand clock runs out, not a problem on this end. \n\nConfit of duck three ways or so it seems. Really a confit leg, some shredded duck and then a breast as well. Quite good, certainly not close to La Cote Basque NYC but pretty decent considering it is served at a bar at 1200pm in Las Vegas. Served by the half-pound or pound, a variety of dipping sauces and a choice of breads to make little sandwiches. The maple soy and black truffle mayo were my favorites. Add another shot of Patron and lunch comes to a close - time for a shower, a nap by the pool and off to the club later in the evening.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The environment is exactly what one with think for being a pub. My fiancé and I were starving on a Wednesday afternoon. We were able to walk right in and choose our own seats. We waited about two minutes before our server, Jeannie, greeted us with waters and menus. She seemed to be one of the only servers on the floor so was running all around the place waiting on her tables. Still, we had great service. My fiancé and I split the Cobb salad and the sliders. We waited about 15 minutes for our food to be delivered. The Cobb salad was delicious. The chicken was fresh, the portion was large, and avocado was perfectly ripe. The salad paired very well with the sliders. There were three sliders and they were delicious. They were only six dollars on the happy hour menu. Altogether, the prices are reasonable here. For our entire lunch with tip and tax included was under $30. A pleasant Las Vegas dining experience and I recommend this restaurant. Addy approved","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The English pub style atmosphere was very welcoming and cozy.\n\nMoment we sat down our waiter greeted us and handed us the menu. Their menu offers an extensive selection pub style food like sandwiches, burgers, fish n chips, hot wings, sliders, salads and other small bites, including raw oyster bar. Average price $20-$26 on menu items so not cheap, but portions are generous and shareable.\n\nWe ordered corn beef reuben, ahi poke and lobster roll slider. Everything was fantastic. The lobster roll sliders were outstanding. Three lightly toasted, buttery buns were busting out the seams with good amount of lobster meat and was very tasty. The cole slaw and freshly made kettle chips were great sides and on point.\n\nI noticed one of the tables across from me ordered an amazing looking bloody mary called \"All About Mary.\" Wow! It was huge (check out my pic) and I wanted one too. Hefty price-tag of $35, but was amazingly good. The bloody mary was stacked with a beef slider, crispy chicken wing, chilled shrimp, corn dog pup, stuffed olives, celery, carrot, pickled asparagus and choice of vodka. I got the Belvedere vodka with mine and it was refreshing. Meal in a glass and everything was delicious. Definitely not just about the drink, but an experience. Note: Takes about 10 minute to make.\n\nThis is my kind of place - good food, great cocktails and perfect pub atmosphere. Plus we had been shopping all morning on Black Friday and were starving. Service was quick and prompt so it surely made an impression on us. They even have a dart board located near our table. Missed the opportunity to play though.

We ordered fish and chips and the chicken pot pie.\n\nThe fish and chips (around $20) weren't anything special. The fish, albeit the quality of the fish is very good, suffered from an overly heavy, crispy batter and too much salt. I'm not sure why there was battered and fried parsley on the plate either. Like eating fish and chips isn't bad enough as it is.\n\nThe chips weren't as crisp as they ought to be. The cole slaw had a combination of peas and cabbage - in the end, it had too much mayo, not enough acidity. \n\nThe accompanying tartar had too much relish added to it. The malt vinegar aioli was unpleasant as well. Sour mayonaise? I'd like to stick to malt vinegar, thank you very much.\n\nThe chicken pot pie fared (around $20) better but still had some issues. Albeit the puff pastry on top was nice, there wasn't enough chicken and veggies underneath. The sauce was a little too thin and rendered the bottom part of the pastry to be too soggy.  Overall, had better chicken pot pie for less.\n\nMy overall experience was okay and the food wasn't bad... it just wasn't great. Despite the issues, the food alone would have been a 3.5.

Their pastry display, variety of lattes, frozen drinks, and meals were very impressive. I decided upon their pumpkin spice latte (I know it's August but it's my favorite flavor) with a chocolate chip coffee cake as a starter; both were equally impressive. When my friend arrived, we ordered breakfast: I ordered the San Dieagan (open face omelette) and she ordered a chorizo burrito (I think it's meant for two people or someone with a big appetite).

Ok, fine, not what I wanted, but if you are going to do it, you couldn't put it under the broiler for like 30 seconds to melt it and heat it? Lazy. The flavor was NIL. Zero. Like eating cardboard. No salt, no pepper, no herbs or spices of any sort. And just thrown on the plate. You eat with your eyes first. Fail. Then you expect to have flavor. Fail. And for it to be hot. Fail. I added hot sauce and salt and it was fine, but not worth buying. My daughter had a hot chocolate that was lukewarm at best, and clearly Swiss Miss from an envelope.

Perhaps today was an \"off\" day for the Coffee Shop, or perhaps the judges on the show just have bad taste, but I find it hard to believe this place won $10,000 for their cupcakes!  After seeing this place on tv, we were in the area today and decided to stop in.  The staff wasn't bad, but not good either, and they seem to be bothered and annoyed by customers, rather than grateful we are keeping them in a job!  On our visit today, there were about 7 or 8 flavors to choose from (however, as a chocoholic, I was disappointed there was only chocolate coconut and a not really chocolate, cookie dough cupcake!).  We decided to try a few out, since none of the flavors were really that enticing.  We got Vanilla Glam, which seemed to be vanilla cupcake with cherry frosting, Lemon Glam, Lemon Raspberry and the Cookie Dough.  All of them were very, very disappointing, borderline gross!  The frostings, with the exception of the Lemon Raspberry, were ok but a bit on the sweet side and way too much artificial flavoring and coloring.  The Lemon Raspberry however was grainy and had a very bad after taste.  The cupcakes themselves however were awful!  They had a very heavy, dense texture,  and they were pretty dry to boot!  And for 4 different flavors, they all had a very similiar taste, the very slight exception being the Raspberry had 2 small bits and the cookie dough with had 2 tiny bits of \"chocolate\".  I'm not sure what they used for chocolate but it tasted cheap and artifical, and not at all like a chocolate chip.  The cupcakes were bad enough as it was, but then the added sting of $12.85 for 4 of them made it even worse.  I will stick with homemade or grocery store cupcakes!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They won the Cupcake Wars?  They were tasty, but I expected way, way more.   I have tasted better from AJ's Finer Foods and got more bang for my buck. I would put the price at $1.50 each max.

The atmosphere is AMAZING!   It is located in Agritopia next to Joe's Farm Grill and the gardens and orchards of Agritopia.  The surroundings are very calming and serene, especially for Phoenix.  The patio is very nice with shaded areas and tables with umbrellas, there is a lot of seating available outdoors for when the weather is nice enough and also inside seating is adequate. The music is luck of the draw.  We are here sometimes when the music is more main stream and it is good, but depending on who is working, you make get the worst mix of music you can imagine.  There have literally been times when the music was so depressing and electronically mind numbing that I have had to get up and leave or try to find some ear plugs.  I am not talking about standard coffee shop music either!  I have definitely had times when I needed to plug into my own tunes when I am there alone.  As far as being there with someone you are trying to converse with and not having the option to close off from the music it is all I can do to just try to tune it out.\n\nNow for the coffee and food portion of the review.  The coffee is very average, in fact the it is luck of the draw also as to if the espresso drinks are going to be bitter and burnt.  Most of the barista's have had little to no training and are just guessing at correct method on pulling the espresso.  I have had a couple who obviously knew more about it and can make a great espresso, but unfortunately, that is not usually the case.  So as far as the coffee portion of this place, I would give a huge thumbs down.  \n\nThe food on the other hand is quite good.  I have had many items from both the breakfast menu and the lunch menu and I am always happy with the food.  Most of the prices are in-line with similar restaurants, but a few things are a little pricey in my opinion.  My favorite item on the menu, along with many others is the Santa Fe, and the Friday Fish Tacos.\n\nThe baked items are very good, with the exception of the cupcakes.  Don't get me wrong, they are still good, in fact very good flavors and choices.  Also the cupcakes are far superior to most of the ones I have tried from the local cupcake shops!  Occasionally they are not as fresh as I would like.  When they are fresh they are superior to most that I have had.  They have real flavor in both the cupcake and the icing, where I think some cupcake stores rely on the flavor of the frosting carrying the cupcakes.\n\nBottom line is if you are a true coffee connoisseur, and you are looking for a good coffee drink, this place is a no good!  If you are looking for atmosphere, good food, and average coffee, then this is your place.  Good luck with the luck of the draw on both the barrista and the music choice of the moment.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I visited once after the owner's first appearance on Cupcake Wars. I was looking forward to trying one of her cupcakes and was disappointed when the restaurant was unusually warm and was filled with flies. I noticed that all the cupcake holder\/plates that are featured in the photo section as \"pastry case\" were uncovered so that flies were landing on many of the displayed cupcakes while many of the staff stood around in a daze. It was unappealing and the cupcakes looked dried out as well.\n\nFortunately there was a larger, sealed display case with shelves, but it had a smaller variety. I chose a flavor (lemon) that was less appealing simply because I didn't want my dessert to have been exposed to farm flies. It took some effort to get attention from the staff and a girl begrudgingly helped me. After several requests, I got a \"to go\" container. \n\nThe cupcake was good enough and moist enough and the price wasn't bad for a cupcake these days. I wouldn't say that it lived up to my expectations. The frosting had almost a floral or pledge-like note, and while I tolerate butter in buttercreams, you can actually see the oily sheen of butter in the swirls of the Shop's cupcakes. I realize that this is a personal preference and that most people really like lots of butter in their confections so you can take this criticism with a grain of salt. In spite of the floral, stick of butter taste, I appreciated that the frosting job was very cute. The store itself was cute too. Hopefully the A\/C works better now and my experience was an anomaly.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Coconut) or Vanilla Americano\n\nThis place can get SUPER busy just like Joe's Farm Grill depending on the time of day and day of the week.

They use a lot of cherry or almond extract without labeling the items as such and I find the flavor off-putting to say the least. Nothing like biting into a vanilla or \"birthday cake\" cupcake only to taste...blech...artificial extract flavoring! Chocolate seems to have it, too. \n\nNot awful, not great. Just eh.

Maybe I'm just used to more down to earth service from the family that runs these businesses.\n\nEverything else was nice.. ambiance is nice and relaxing.. open.  The back room has couches to lounge in and that's nice, but the place is supposed to be a coffee place and it felt pretty crowded and noisy with families and couples eating and not necessarily relaxing and having a coffee.  You get a more 'coffee shop' feel from other area coffe shops...\n\nI think the staff attitude and the \"hipster\" air they put out just was more off-putting than I expected from a local run small business that is NOT in Tempe or Scottsdale.. come on, gimme a break.","useful":7,"funny":2,"cool":0}

Cute neighborhood coffee shop feel. Very \"friends\" -esque.  \n\nI always get the SAN DIEGAN open faced omelette with avocado and a side of salsa. Light egg pancake smeared with sour cream, crispy bacon, caramelized mushrooms, crisp browned potatoes, topped with cheddar cheese, super fresh feta, and green onions!!!! Adding avocado is extra. What makes it is smothering it in their house made salsa. BOTTLE IT!!! I will take 10 cases please. Perfect amount of acidity, slight heat, and a surprising sweetness!! \n\nMy fiancée has the same dish cling problems with the TJ open face omelette. Same idea but with a tasty flavorful chorizo! (He also avocados and salsas it) \n\nThe only downside to this place is the seating. We come here on weekends and even weekday mornings and find it hard to find seating inside. A lot of patrons linger with laptops or books. But it is a coffee shop so I guess it's understandable. Just a little inconvenient during the summer but we have no shame and will eat in the car!

Once more, a \"Joe's\" project that has a retro\/modern industrial feel. \n\nThe dining room has a nice amount of tables and chairs and there is a sitting room at the back with some comfy couches and coffee tables - definitely a cozy spot. The large patio is lovely when the weather is right and the surrounding foliage keeps it from befalling the \"parking lot effect\" that so many Arizona patios face (parking lot effect definition: a great patio that is spoiled by a view of parked cars, smells of exhaust, and sounds of traffic - those things the Coffee Shop is NOT, thank goodness) \n\nThey have an awesome bakery counter (My favorite thing!) Try to get there in the morning for some DELICIOUS muffins, which are shaped like little loaves instead of like traditional muffins. I always try to find random seasonal flavors that aren't always there - the best one I've had was a strawberry lemon poppyseed muffin - to die for! Also high marks to the cinnamon roll, a peanut butter chocolate scone, and any of the cupcakes. The cookies and whoopie pies are hit and miss - they look adorable but don't quite stand up to the other offerings. \n\nThe food-food is also great - again, my preference is breakfast and we always share the Papas Breakfast Burrito (with eggs, bacon, potatoes, and salsa) as it is HUGE and definitely large enough for two, particularly if you're also getting a pastry. I've tried the Turkey Cranberry sandwich at lunchtime and it was tasty as well. \n\nI have not actually had their coffee, but my sister and grandmother, who are both connoisseurs, swear by it so I feel comfortable recommending that as well. As for me, I'm usually ordering a big glass of fresh OJ. \n\nI wish that they were open later (they close at 8 or 9pm most nights, 4pm on Sundays) - its the type of place I often think of for a late night snack and coffee once I've put the little one to bed and I'm always disappointed to remember they're already closed!\n\nLastly, as of my last visit with my son they did NOT have a changing table in the women's bathroom. Considering the large numbers of families\/moms who frequent the shop, it really seems like a given and I was a bit shocked that they didn't have one - I ended up toting my son and what was left of my meal out to my SUV to change his diaper in the back, which doesn't exactly match up to the serene coffee shop experience I'm planning on when I come out to the Coffee Shop :)","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2}

It's a great place to have brunch with the neighbors, meet a friend for lunch, or just kill some time while you wait for your cleaning ladies to finish up.\n\nI get iced coffee a lot, and I appreciate the stevia packets nearby since they dissolve quickly. Their chai is very good, more sweet than spicy. \n\nBreakfast is wonderful especially since they added some new menu items like the rosa sandwich with egg whites and pesto. I also love the vegan benedict. They really know how to season and cook tofu properly. The San Diegan is everyone's favorite; I sub avocado for bacon.\n\nLunch is great too. The tomato basil sandwich is one of the best veggie sandwhiches I've ever had. I often make my own version at home during the summer. The vegan taco salad wrap is killer too. I gave half to a meat and potatoes coworker, and he loved it! My husband and neighbor both love the turkey cranberry sandwich and order it almost every time we go.\n\nThey are known for their desserts for good reason. Scones are my favorite, perhaps because they contain an almost lethal amount of butter. The vegan red velvet cupcake is much better than the one at Sprinkles. I'm sure that it helps that it's made by an actual vegan (one of the co-owners).  I was hesitant to try the coffee and cigarettes cupcake, but my curiosity finally got to me. I was surprised how much I liked it. It was like a more flavorful and complex vanilla. I've never smoked so I couldn't taste the tobacco, but my husband said the tobacco flavor is there.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2}

The creme cheese replacement spread they had was outstanding. And the almonds and honey made it perfect.

When I walked up to the counter to order, I couldn't help but to browse at the different pasteries, cup cakes, and sweets they had displayed. As I took a closer look, there were a HANDFUL of flies landing all over the baked goods and sweets. I told the cashier who helped me first thing. All the cashier did was walk over, shoo the flies away, and proceeded to take people's orders. Not only did she not do anything to continue to repel the flies, but she failed to even let anyone know that they needed to be switched out. This is not only unsanitary, but it is a red flag to me that profits off of goods infested with flies is more important than  customer's well-being. I had to warn the ladies who were ordering in front of me to take a closer look at the display. They too, were disgusted and ended up walking out of the shop. Did the cashier or anyone in the back kitchen proceed to do anything? Absolutely not. It is astonishing that they would rather lose customers than to be concerned of the quality and cleanliness of their food. I hope that who ever decides to go into The Coffee Shop that they should keep a close eye on their food and the swarms of flies that land on it. So ridiculous and DISGUSTING.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I watch a crapload of FN programming, but even I couldn't put up with 15 hours of Food Network Challenge a week, much less three other shows that are the exact same format with mildly different food as the focus. It's some of Scripps' highest-rated shows, so someone's watching it, or forgetting they left the TV on while they went to go make dinner. \n\nIn any case, it shouldn't detract from the accomplishments of Flowers\/Cuff, because they made the best cupcake I've ever tasted. It was a cranberry\/lemon thing, and despite the large swirl of frosting that matched the quantity of the cake itself, nothing felt overpowered between the sweetness, the fruit, and the citrus.

I'm a fan of a good cupcake.\nMy shock was seeing that in fact, the lady working the kitchen line, was a face I recognized from Cupcakes Wars. She was very gracious and came around to take a picture with me. I had a lot of fun with that encounter since I'm a big fan of the show and had seen the episode she competed on.\n\nBesides The Coffee Shop and Joe's Farm Grill (which I only saw walking past, separate building, same farm) , you'll see the community gardens, labeled plants growing everywhere, paths to walk on, very nice. They also have farmer's markets twice weekly.\n\nI found the place to be charming, the food tasty, and the people very nice.

They were featured on The Food Network Channel and won \"The Cupcake Wars\" TV contest. The cupcakes are to die for and well worth the visit. The menu is constantly changing along with the other breakfast and lunch menu items. \n\nThe most unique aspect to The Coffee Shop is the location in Agritopia, a farming community, situated next door to the most famous Gilbert, AZ restaurant, Joe's Farm Grill. Joe's is ALWAYS PACKED FULL and it's hard to get a decent outdoor table. All of their menu items are farm fresh and the produce is picked right next to the restaurant. Talk about organic! It's an amazing experience to eat outdoors, next to the view of the farm where the food is grown. \n\nAfter your meal, go next door to The Coffee Shop for dessert. The only issue I have with The Coffee Shop is that it should be bigger inside with more tables. There are some outdoor café tables, but of course it's just too hot in AZ in the summer to eat outdoors! It's always a surprise and a pleasure dining out.

I decided to check out this place. (Thanks yelpers!)\n\nThe Coffee Shop is cute -- there are lots of windows filling the place with natural light and it also gave the place a more spacious feeling. It wasn't too crowded when I went there but there were enough people where you could feel comfortable and not have to worry about feeling suffocated, or even worse, being watched by employees (paranoid, much?)\n\nI ordered the tomato basil sandwich, which also came with mozzarella, onion, avocado, and feta cheese. The tomatoes that were in my sandwich were one of the best tasting things I've ever had. Other than that the sandwich was kind of salty (because of the feta cheese I think?) but the amount of tomatoes they added helped balance the overall flavor.\n\nI also got to try the pesto chicken sandwich, which I thought was even better than the sandwich that I ordered. The pesto was SO GOOD!  I would (and will) order that sandwich next time I am here. \n\nThe best part about the sandwiches is that they tasted so fresh that it almost made me think it could offset the load of processed crap I consumed this past week (damn you, guilt).\n\nI didn't try any of their drinks or cupcakes (see: binge) but I do plan on coming back to try them out because they looked really good. They had an interesting selection of cupcakes with plump frosting tops that came in cute names like \"lemon glam\" and \"sweetheart cherry\".

She had heard they had the best cupcakes in all of Arizona and I had to see if it was true. I ordered the berry cupcake for her and I. The cupcake itself had lots of fresh berries inside and the frosting was light and decadent. The cupcake was amazing overall.\n\nThe inside of the coffee shop has a homey, modern vibe to it. There are wood tables, fresh flowers and even the coffee bar is made of wood. The inside vibe is relaxing and your typical coffee culture you have come to expect. Plenty of patio seating outside and lots of free parking of course. \n\nNow for the coffee...I am a coffee snob. The coffee that my husband and I ordered was not very good. It was alright but some of the flavors just did not blend well. My husband ordered a cinnamon flavored one and it was terrible. It just tasted like strong coffee with tons of sugar and syrup. I was not impressed and would not go back to get a coffee. \n\nSadly this place is called \"The Coffee Shop\" and the only good thing I consumed there was a cupcake. I would not recommend the coffee. I'm sure the tea is a lot better and don't forget a cupcake. You won't be disappointed with that.

Such was the case here, but it was ok. The absolute standout for me was the peanut butter scone. Never had one, or even heard of one before. It lived up to my hopes and I enjoyed every moment I spent eating it. \n\nAdded bonus, the fresh dates were out at the farm stand. However, the plastic thing on the wall that was supposed to hold the cash for the honor system was empty of envelopes. I asked at the coffee shop but they didn't know. Said it was a different place. Well, ok, I went back. Stuck my money in the plastic thing. Figured even if someone else took it at least I did my part. It wouldn't be on my conscience.

The service at the Coffee Shop used to be so great. It used to be nothing but friendly, helpful people giving \"service with a smile.\" But today? The exact opposite.\n\nSo, to The Coffee Shop employees, in case you don't know this already, this is how it works: when you forget to put in an order so that only one of our meals comes out to us, but the other meal does not even get started until we ask where it's at 15 minutes later...that is YOUR fault. You should apologize; and you should not look at me like I'm being a trouble maker. [I'm still waiting on an apology, by the way.]\n\nAnd when a customer has a complaint, do not stand there doe-eyed and silent hoping that the problem will just go away if you stay quiet enough. That's not how it works. Instead, address the issue: admit the mistake and correct it. And when you deliver the missing food -- the mistake YOU made -- do not drop it on the table like you're doing me a favor and I'm lucky to be sitting there.\n\nAnd no, it wasn't just me having a bad day or something. The table next to us overheard our complaints, and chimed in how appalled they were at the horrible service they received today too. In fact, the palpably bad attitude left such a bad taste in all of our mouths, I don't think any of us could really appreciate how good the flavor of the food was. I know I couldn't\/didn't.\n\nI hope the owner\/manager checks up on their reviews. Because if the service to be expected is anything like what we received today, we will not be back.","useful":13,"funny":3,"cool":2}

I am a mile or so away from this place I love the ambiance, the streamed music (though sometimes loud for the acoustics), the wiFi, and the food. Oh, wait. I love the Cafe Mochas too. The people who work here are the greatest, and the whole experience is of a nice little coffee cafe where you can get breakfast, coffee, lunch, and dessert, all in one place. My favorite coffee spot since I moved here due to the overall experience and convenience of being so close. Now all I need is a Scooter so I can hook up on weekends for rides. \n\nThe food is pretty good. I like the variety, and thankfully they have added to their menu recently. I would still like to see more options though, and if they offered more specials it would be a breath of fresh air. I would also like to see a few salad options. I know I would love to forgo the bread many times and just have a large salad with fresh organic ingredients. Maybe one day they will add salads to the menu. The fact that they add almost vegetarian options is wonderful. With all of the fast food and chain restaurants around, I'm happy to frequent a place that tries to serve healthier, fresher, options. \n\nOne thing they can improve upon is the fly situation. The flies do make contact with the cupcakes. If they were to keep the cupcakes in the display sealed, this would resolve that issue. But realize the fly situation is just as  bad at Joe's Farm Grill. It's due to the openness of the buildings, so there's no getting rid of them. But, you can cut down on them making contact with the food by keeping the desserts in a closed display. That little investment alone will put people at ease. Again, I've been to Joe's Farm Grill next door where I had to leave due to the flies. It's those open buildings. The best they can do is cut down by being extremely clean in picking up debris and adding a sealed upper display case so the flies don't have the opportunity to land on the desserts.\n\nAs for the complaints about the kids from someone above, there are days that the kids are all over the place, which is what kids do. I don't have kids, so that can be unnerving. Depends on the time of day. It's not like that all the time. Also, this is a neighborhood of families, so what did you expect? Although it's wonderful for you to have this daydream of studying here or doing your business, it's a restaurant\/coffee shop. It's going to have noise and activity. Frankly, I hate it when I see the place crowded and find that the students or business people with their laptops have monopolized the whole area though they are no longer eating or drinking. That table you're hogging could be used for someone else who will actually be eating their meal there. So, do your studying at home if it bothers you, or better yet, the library. \n\nAll this being said, I still love going here as the people who work there are very nice and always greeting you with a positive vibe.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Here? Thank you Starbucks, for convincing the Masses that paying more than a quarter for a cup of Joe was acceptable, even mainstream! \n\nLovely space, well decorated, by a person with taste, flair and fun, NOT by a committee or a panel or by customer survey. , lots of wood, with a sitting room in the back for your lazy hanging out needs. \n\nRatty recliners? Not here, Nice... VERY nice leather chairs and sofa with driftwood tables scattered about. Nice artwork on the walls, mixing family photo's, nature photography with understated rock and Roll pictures. (having a pic of Jim Morrisons grave is cool, having a UNPRETENTOUS picture of Jim Morrison's grave is worth a star of its own, there is a fare farmers market out front, but for myself, I like to park in the rear and walk through the garden and patio... It's a oasis amidst the sprawl, the explosion of colors and aromas are a extra treat that shouldnt be missed.\n\nThis family understands that the atmosphere, the music, the creation and integration into the lifeblood of the community is what makes a coffeehouse so effen awesome.\nand effen awesome it is!\n \n\nAnd probably most importantly... full of the exact friendly faces you need when getting your java on. \n\nHomemade sugar goodness is available. It's the sort of thing that one dreams coming from your own kitchen, but with a tad more color and odd combinations (Coffee and Cigarettes cupcakes anyone?), to intice you in. Displayed in the front case, drawing you in like a moth to a flame,  like Teri Garr in Young Frankenstein... wholesome goodness you want to introduce your Mom to, yet you know it's soooo bad for you...

It's normal that new people need to be trained, and that any amount of training will not equal years of experience.\nAs other coffeehouses fight and cut corners in these tough times, it says a lot that The Coffee Shop is growing and healthy. \n\nStill, with that all said, this is my favorite coffeehouse in years, \n\nThis is a perfect companion to Joes Farm Grill next door. (many reviews on Yelp and elsewhere) Together, they are reason for my Bride and I to want to move to the Agritopia subdivision they are a part of, just to be able to walk there in the morning, along the tree lined streets (rare around here in a work of cactus and ... dirt)","useful":7,"funny":4,"cool":6}

All of that having been said I have a HUGE food crush on a little gem hidden in Gilbert, Arizona at a place called Agritopia, I'm speaking of course of \"The Coffee Shop.\"\n\nWith such a simple name you would be tempted to assume this was a mere coffee shop slinging run of the mill or even above average coffee drinks and you would be WRONG.  While The Coffee Shop does in fact serve up coffee drinks as expected, it is not caffeine which drew me in or keeps me going back.\n\nLets begin with how I found them and what has brought me to today.  A few weeks ago Joe's Farm Grill was having their 5th Annual customer appreciation day (they served in the neighborhood of 4000 free cheeseburgers but more on that later) and trusty pal Mikey and I dropped in to have a burger and fries.  As we were leaving, I decided I wanted to stop by The Coffee Shop (which is on the same parcel of land) to see what It was all about.\nUpon walking inside, the salivation began.  There, arranged before me was just about the most mouthwatering display of cupcakes and whoopie pies I have ever seen.  The first thing that caught my eye were the Coconut creme whoopie pies, seemingly very plain but with the promise of greatness if done well...and they were!\n \nThese Coconut creme whoopies are just about the best things I have ever eaten (and Ive eaten a LOT).  Unlike many of the whoopie wannabe's I've eaten in the past, the pastry chef here achieved the perfect balance of sweetness, moisture and density with the most pleasant, light crunchy outer texture.  So flavorful was the shell that I was almost taken aback by the creme filling that was obviously made with absolute care and devotion to the craft.  Simply incredible (I feel like there should be a new Food Network show called \"Whoopie Pie Wars!\")\n\nOn to the next bit of tastiness in the form of a tray lined with cupcakes whose sign read \"Chocolate chip cookie dough,' YES please.  They looked simple, well decorated but not overdone and I was keen to try one. No flaccid, tasteless frosting here, there's butter creme on that there cupcake.  Sprinkled with chocolate chips and what looks like chocolate Disco dust was the best tasting buttercream I can remember having eaten.  They've somehow been able to create the essence of cookie dough in cake form, a bit of gooeyness, great flavor and yes, i'd eat a whole bag of them.\nThe PB&J cupcake found its way into my mouth next and took me back to my Grandmothers kitchen with her homemade bread, peanut butter and preserves only BETTER (sorry Grandma), it was deliciously dense, the peanut butter buttercream (say that 5 times really fast) was sweet, creamy and perfectly accompanied but a little dab of jelly on top (along with a generous squirt in the middle of the cupcake.) I highly recommend this one.\n\nI did grab a few other cupcakes before lapsing into a sugar induced coma including cake batter, coconut and a strawberry one I got pictures of and ate but whose clever name I cannot remember (terrible journalist...oh, wait, as a Blogger I admire recently wrote, I'm not a \"professional journalist!\").  Everything i've had so far has caused me to make the 40 mile trek from home to The Coffee Shop for a treat I just can't find anywhere else in the Valley.  If you desire a creative, perfectly made treat, get into your car and make the trip from wherever you might be to THe Coffee Shop at Agritopia.\n \nCheck out the Chefs responsible for the creations I've mentioned and more on their recent winning episode of  Cupcake Wars on the Television Food Network.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Maybe because the line is long enough to get 1 of my favorite breakfast meals that I don't want the line to be any longer. Unfortunately, the word is out because this place is action packed even on the weekdays.\nI found this little gem while eating next door. It sits nestled in a quaint garden of flowers and greenery. Open patio seating in the front and rear. So beautiful and serene, It's easy to imagine yourself anywhere but Gilbert, AZ. Ordering takes place inside. Step up to the counter and the entire menu is chalk boarded on the wall. Delicious baked goods taunt you from the display case. Gourmet coffee harmoniously filling the air tempting your taste buds. If your not excited let me know and I'll grab the defibrillator. \nI've tried several items on the menu but the 1's that impress me the most is the San Diegan. It's an open faced omelette with mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, feta cheese, Shredded cheese and I think a couple other things. Delish!! On the weekends, if your lucky you can catch an amazing biscuits and gravy or an eggs Benedict. Mind blown! Tempt your taste buds with a baked delicacy, my advice the faux doughnut. What does that mean exactly.... The doughnut is baked instead of fried.

I was torn between The Farm next door and this place since they were right next door to each other.  For whatever reason, I chose the Coffe Shop.... I had already been to Starbucks and had just a few sips of my iced coffee left.  Rather than let it melt in the car, I decided to put the cup in my handbag.  While waiting in line to order several breakfasts to go, the owner came up to me and said I was not allowed to bring in any outside food or beverages, as she had seen my straw sticking out of my handbag!  I found that to be EXTREMELY POOR customer service!  First of all, had I planned to finish my last few sips in her restaurant, would it really have made an impact on her business?  Secondly, I wasn't planning on drinking it in there, I merely didn't want it to melt, so I stashed it in my own handbag!!! Really???  I promptly left the restaurant and went to The Farm, which was absolutely delicious!!!!  The breakfast tacos are to die for!  In addition, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  A bit of advice, if you're ever faced with the decision of breakfast at the Coffee Shop or The Farm, don't hesitate.... GO TO THE FARM, you won't be disappointed:)\n\nVicky, Scottsdale AZ","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Their coffee was also very good, we both had iced lattes but will want to come back and try their \"monsoons\".  The prices are a tiny bit higher than my liking, but worth an occasional visit.\n\nOverall fabulous place and will return with friends!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The area first off is absolutely beautiful. It's in this fantastically gorgeous spot in gilbert surrounded by lots of greenery; trees, grass, flowers, all things that arizonans are not usually accustomed to. First impressions were that this place was slammed. Inside was rocking and it was a friday morning. Wide drink selection, good (not great) food. I had a supreme breakfast burrito. It wasn't the best, lacked some flavor, but the portion was huge and kept me satisfied. I sat in some cool upholstered chairs and just took in the ambience. Lots of students, but you see a lot of young families in there also. The place looks like it is being run by teenagers and the nicki minaj with +7 bass that popped on the stereo at 9 am confirmed that fact. Real cool place to hang out and get some work done.

Even my girlfriend, who doesn't like coffee, tried it and thought it was bomb.

I decided that I would take the trip and see if it is as good as was stated on the show. \nOf course I checked the Yelp reviews and they were very favorable, so my fiance and I decided to go for breakfast. The only downside was we didn't get there until about 12:45pm and they stop selling breakfast at noon Mon thru Sat.. Of course that was our issue. Sunday they serve breakfast all day. \nEven though we were looking to have breakfast we got sandwiches instead. I had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich on Sourdough Bread and my fiance had the Chicken Salad on croissant. Both sandwiches were excellent. Great flavor, fresh ingredients is how I would describe both of them. Now for those you folks that like loads of food when you go out to eat, these sandwiches were just enough, not too filling. Which left room for one of the incredibly lushish sweet delicacies that they serve. \n\nMy fiance had the Boston Creme Cupcake and I had the Lemon Cupcake with sparkles on them. All I can say is \"Forget About It\" these cakes were Fantabulous. You must get a sweet something when you go here. Finally, it's a little hard to find but it's in Agritopia subdivision on the north side of Ray. You will see \"The Farm Stand Market\" sign - turn here.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Since becoming a regular, I've gotten to know the staff and their names, and they know exactly what I want every time I come in; although, that's pretty simple, as it's just a medium black coffee. Given that their drip system is a fairly standard one, you can expect the same brew every time. While I would love it if they went a bit more high-end in their regular coffee brewing, I can't complain too much. They source their beans from Mr. Espresso, which is based out of California. Would I prefer it to be something a little more local? Yes, especially given that most of their other ingredients for food is locally sourced; but again, this is a relatively minor quibble. If you choose to go the espresso route with a latte, cappuccino, etc., then you'll more than likely be satisfied. My guess is that most of the customers who frequent here wouldn't consider themselves to be coffee snobs, so I never really overhear much complaining on their part. \n\nThe Coffee Shop's ace in the hole, however, is their cupcakes. While I'm not a cupcake critic, I've never been anything less than pleased with what they have to offer. You'll find an assortment of unique and endearing choices, from Birthday Cake Cupcake to blueberry scones, and more. My personal favorite is the Red Velvet Cupcake, but I've also tried their signature item: Coffee & Cigarettes. While the name isn't the most appealing, it's what won them an episode of The Cupcake Wars, and I can see why. \n\nAside from sweets, they offer a pretty decent menu of healthy sandwhiches and wraps. However, if you can, go in the morning and grab something from their breakfast menu, such as The San Diegan. This open faced omelette will literally open your face with delight (whatever that means). \n\nThe only real drawback to The Coffee Shop can be summed up in the immortal words of Yogi Berra, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\" Given that it's situated on an idealic urban farm that tends to play home to the more hip and socially conscious crowd of Gilbert, you can expect to have to deal with long lines and relatively little seating due to the sheer number of humans. The inside decor and vibe is pretty open and rustic, as it's a converted tractor barn, complete with concrete walls, an open aired dining and seating area situated between two walls of near floor-to-ceiling windows, and a backroom filled with comfortable couches and chairs. The natural light poors in nicely, though it can create a bit of a glare at certain times of the day. Seating is available outside, but on hot summer days you'll probably have to fistfight someone for a spot indoors. Since it's also a coffee shop, you'll more than likely see idiots like me taking up a table for inordinate amounts of time while slowly sipping on their brew and typing away on their devices. That's just how it is, so be prepared and ready. Besides, if you're just getting a drink, you can always grab your beverage and take a nice walk through the beautiful urban farm area and enjoy nature a little. Your mom always says you need to get outside more. \n\nIn all, The Coffee Shop is one of the best destinations for food, coffee, and hanging out in the East Valley. Does it have its areas it could improve on? Of course; nearly every establishment does. However, there's a reason I come here most days to do my writing, so they're definitely doing something right.","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":2}

I was traveling in a small group that included a seven month old baby, while boarding in Las Vegas, the woman at the boarding station was the opposite of helpful and in fact very rude. (Name tag read, Fonza.) On the previous flight we were all able to board between A and B as a family with the baby, this time around we were rudely told that only 1 person could board the \"family boarding.\" (I guess family means 1 adult and 1 baby.) We were all separated for our 5 hour flight and the baby was highly distressed. When we inquired about why only one person was allowed to board with the child, \"Fonza\" ignored any question we had and insisted we get back in line. Once boarding, I saw her arguing with another customer and giving\nhim unnecessary attitude, when he too, just asked a question. The flight itself was very long and I spent most of it worried about the rest of my family and the baby. The air staff were altogether not very friendly or observant of apparent things like garbage piled up in the walking row of the plane.

If you need to cancel last minute, they'll give you points. If you need to swap flights, you only pay the difference in fare if there is one. If you need to bring a hockey bag + golf clubs on a flight, you can at no additional cost as they already factored it into the price.

I leave on Sunday or Monday and return on Thursday or Friday.  I have been doing this for the last 10 years.\n\nAs you can imagine, I have flown on virtually every airline.  Early on, I was a regular on the big ones.  In the summer of 2006, that changed.  It was a Thursday evening and my flight out of Chicago O'Hare was cancelled due to inclement weather.  To my surprise, all flights out of nearby Midway airport were operating.    From then on, I pledged to avoid O'Hare and, in the process, discovered Southwest Airlines, which serves Midway with direct flights to many parts of the country.\n\nTo most road warriors, Southwest is a love or hate relationship.  The haters detest its single-class and open seating arrangements.  They do not care for Southwest's absence in the international market, which limits options for reward travel.\n\nAll things considered, I have become a big fan of Southwest.  Here's why:\n1) It's the only airline that does not charge a fee for changing reservations.\n2) The first two bags checked in are free.\n3) While no longer a true discount airline, its fares are always competitive.\n4) It flies into many smaller airports, which are easier to get in and out of.\n5) The single-aircraft model permits fast gate turnaround and efficient maintenance.\n6) The flight crews appear to enjoy their work and inject a sense of humor into most flights.\n7) It has developed a vast network of U.S. destinations and recently added Mexico to its portfolio.\n8) The revamped rapid rewards program eliminates blackout dates, enhances free flight redemption, and adds international travel rewards through its credit card.\n\nEvery airline wrestles with flight delays, lost luggage, and obnoxious passengers.  Southwest is no exception; but, it has consistently ranked high in all customer satisfaction surveys because it deals with the negatives better than other airlines.\n\nSouthwest has the image of a no-frills, discount airline with the cattle-call passenger loading process.  It has been the butt of late-night comedy jokes.  Some of that has changed over the years.  What has remained is its ability to deliver consistently acceptable service with a smile and tongue firmly in cheek.  In an industry where mediocrity is the norm, that is exceptional.  This year is Southwest's 40th anniversary.  I salute its management and staff.  Keep up the good work for the next 40.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If I can fly with Southwest, I will do ( Denver, Vegas, Dallas, Chicago... You name it)  \nOne of my lovely experience with them was amazing!\n\nI have no idea how I missed my plane flying from Las Vegas, NV  back to San Francisco, California, while I was sitting at the gate... I was reading a book and must have spaced it out that I haven't even heard my name when they called me or must have been still excited about my friend's wedding that I went to and me being their wedding photographer.... \nA very nice employee\/ agent at the desk was so helpful and gave me a few options and sent me right away to a different terminal to catch my new flight that was flying to Oakland, California. \nI landed even before my original time that was scheduled to San Francisco Airport. \nThe only thing I had to take care of, was to get my luggage from the originally scheduled airport. That was totally fine with me. The most important thing for me was that I needed to be back that day and that mission was 100 percent accomplished.\n\nSouthwest is one of my favorite airline! They have always great deal! You can bring your luggage for free on a plane. There is no change fees in case you need to cancel your flight or you keep your credit if needed.\nTheir boarding system is a bit different from the other airlines which I totally don't mind at all. I think unassigned seating is not bad at all. \nSouthwest employee\/ agents are always smiling and nice and willing to help! \n\nLook forward to fly with Southwest Airline again!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

There is absolutely no excuse for rudeness by counter personnel. The information board behind the counter stated the flight was on time. We had been waiting for at least 30 minutes to board not knowing that flight had been cancelled. When I went up to the counter, Jillian, the most rudest of them all, stated she had announced the flight had been cancelled.  There was 4 of us and many others waiting to board this cancelled flight and amazingly none of us heard this ghost of an announcement.  She then said to go get in line. Once we finally made it to the counter again, 1 of us got on the next flight and the other 3 had to wait till the evening flight.  I asked Jillian why the board behind her still shows the flight as being on time. She stated the City controls the board - WHAT!! Unbelievable.

I flew  on eight Southwest flights in 2014.... Seven of those flights were either delayed by several hours or canceled completely. I also have to just say first off that giving one star to this company is way too generous. The last trip from Phoenix to Vegas was my last straw. A five minute plane maintenance delay turned into a five hour nightmare. Had the aircraft not been 100% full, the first hour would have been a little more tolerable while I sat on the overheated runway with absolutely no communication or update from the staff about the delay. I was told \"only ten more minutes\" on five separate occasions. I deplaned and was rerouted on standby so I lost my \"A\/ boarding group place in line and was the very last person on the next overcrowded aircraft. When I finally arrived in Las Vegas I had discovered that bags were misplaced and transferred to a flight that would cost me another two hour delay. My returning flight from Las Vegas to Phoenix was of course also delayed because of faulty equipment, and I could not be rerouted to the next flight out because that aircraft was also delayed because of bad equipment!!! I am writing this review right now as I am sitting at the airport in Las Vegas wondering how many more lies the Southwest staff are going to put me through before I can finally get back to Phoenix. \n\nI can deal with a delay every now and then but with Southwest Airlines I have dealt with a delay and or other problems over 90% of the time I fly with them. I booked this round trip flight about a month ago and southwest was maybe about twenty five dollars cheaper then US airways and United. Please, please,  please.... save yourself the time and stress and pick ANY other airline besides Southwest! My Christmas was officially ruined by this airline and I have nothing positive to say about this company or the staff. If you respect yourself in any way at all then do not fly Southwest until they start getting their S$$t together, which I'm sure won't be for a long long time.","useful":5,"funny":4,"cool":4}

The first leg went up to Orlando FL to drop off passengers. It was a bearable flight although longer than expected. Then, it turned westward to Las Vegas. Young people who got on sounding happy and healthy, ended up coughing and wheezing.  Something definitely was wrong with the cabin air to make healthy young folk very sick.  \n\nBut then it got really bad.  Once we landed, there was roughly an hour layover. We get a mumbled announcement that the flight taking us to LAX would be delayed by 10 minutes.  Then 10 minutes go by and another announcement adds an hour past 11 pm, due to wind conditions. We were quite puzzled. Wind conditions? Apparently we were unaware of the huge fires whipped up in the Southland at that time. So we asked if we can get vouchers. Instead, we were told we can stay as long as we like at the airport (and freeze).  All the amenities at this so-called international airport in Vegas closed down.  Not even hot tea or coffee was available--even for purchase.  Hours continued on with no flight in sight.  We were told another crew was coming but then they had exhausted their time and had to stop, basically telling us to buzz off. More mumbling announcements. \n\nSouthwest did not want to say that they were now the cause of the delays, not some weather or natural phenomenon.  One family was able to get vouchers for the family and kids so they can come back the following morning.  Now it was not until way past 1:30 am that a flight finally showed up.  The crew looked at us like we better not complain like they were doing us a favor! All of a sudden the announcements were crystal clear to hear and understand. Check in and board now!  You did not have to ask us twice to do that. We were freezing cold and pissed as hell. \n\nHow could Southwest Airlines drop the ball so badly. How could Las Vegas McCarren Airport turn out to be a two-bit hick town??? Very very pathetic and disappointing to say the least. The on-board announcement says thanks for your business and it will only be a 40 minute flight to LA. Well I checked my watch and it ended up being a 90 minute flight. Very different time sense if you ask me. And we caught a sinus infection with persistent coughing to boot.  \n\nThanks for nothing Southwest Airlines. We will seriously rethink this airline when we choose to fly again.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's a mess if u ask me. So please work on sign seats since we paid for that seat. I don't want to fight for it. But I appreciate The flight attendant for her help. Had to bribe a person by buying him a drink to move for us to sit together. \nThank you for that Lady.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I was in the C group which is the worst because you are the last one on the plane which means you have to fight Mike Tyson to find a seat and to find a spot to put your carry-on.\n\nWhen people have a small back pack and don't put it under their seat it causes people with a bigger carry-on to have a problem. I couldn't beleive all the people who were doing this non-sense and the flight unattended didn't do nothing about it.

You can use the credit for another travel date and destination.  The only problem is that when you don't use the credit within a year, you lose the amount but could call for a 6 month extension minus 100.00 dollars.   Love the airline for domestic travel.    \n    \nBuying Early Bird can be a good & bad (Early Bird allows SWA to check you in early automatically). The groups are A,B,C etc  with up to 60 people boarding in each group.  I did get B30 one time and was not happy.   Wasn't worth the purchase because that meant almost 100 people before me bought Early Bird passes.  Then, of course, they say there may be a glitch in their system and they can't do anything about it.    Thus...it might not be great to get  Early Bird at times.  \n\nOverall.

No hidden fees.  No baggage fees.  \n\n2.  Open seating.\n\n3.  Zone boarding.  \n\n4.  Beverages served on the flight.\n\nmore NOTES:  The check in process at both LAS and MDW was quick and efficient.  We merely presented our IDs to the attendant, he tagged our luggage, printed our boarding passes, and sent us on our way to the security check point and gate.\n\nThe boarding process, much like checking-in, was efficient and organized.

On the plane, the fight attendants were attentive in directing passengers to open seats as well as assisting others with stowing their luggage in the overhead compartments,\n\nBEST:  For me personally, the absolute best part about the entire flight (to MDW) was the humorous flight attended conducting the announcements.  As an example, he provided comical and witty explanation of the safety features and equipment, going as far as to compare the life jackets as a fashion statement and the illuminated lights on the walkway as the \"runway.\"  In any case, my attempt at describing the comic relief does no justice to his actual speeches, but I can honestly say most passengers elicited chuckles whenever he spoke.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and positive experience flying with Southwest Airlines.","useful":9,"funny":7,"cool":9}

Because Southwest stacks their flights so close if one flight is delayed you are almost guaranteed to miss the next one.\n\nUnfortunately the last 5 flights I have had with them have been either delayed or canceled.

Never had a problem. Their customer service representatives go above and beyond, in person and over the phone. Every time I call them with a question, they have an answer. Theres no ring around the rosies (which Ive had with other airlines). Last june our flight was delayed 3 hours with having a toddler. The southwest ladies at the desk offered snacks, drinks and entertainment for her, since the food area was closed.\n\n2. They allow each person 2 checked bags for free! Other airlines charge $25-50 each bag. With 3 of us flying we always bring 3 bags and on our way bag we're able to buy items and bring them in an extra bag for no charge or worries. \n\n3. Cheap flights! With the economy now adays, everyone wants to save a buck and this is where we save the most. Southwest constantly has amazing deals throughout the year. Weve gotten tickets as cheap as 49 bucks each way! Good example is their  wanna get away deals. They normally run 72 bucks each way, which is a really great deal for last minute flights or popular cities like Miami, Los Angeles, New York, etc. No hidden fees. What you see online is the exact price. I love that!\n\n4. Their Rapid Rewards Program. Every time you book a flight you get points. Those points add up quickly. Once you earn 25,000 you get a free flight. Use your southwest credit card to book the flight and you double your points. BOOM. Free flights easily!\n\n5. You can check in online 24 hours before for free, and get seating first. All the seats are the same and theres no first class. Another thing I love is you get to pick your seat. Front, back or middle.. your choice?! I personally like to pick seats (when traveling with my daughter) near other kids. Hey, then they can all be loud together OR they understand as my kid acts up because they have one and understand the feeling. other times, im on a peaceful trip and want to be left alone... I'm able to pick a secluded seat all by myself. YAY! \n\n6. Want to make a change to your flight because you want to stay a couple extra days?! No problem! Just call and they will adjust your flight for no cost! Woohoo.\n\nFor those 6 reasons I give southwest 5 stars!","useful":7,"funny":1,"cool":8}

I then overheard the woman imply that she's a disabled navy veteran and needed to change flight information regarding her toddler. Contrary to my expectation, Steve showed no empathy and Mr. Eaton supported it. I didn't want to allow myself to believe it was related to the woman's race, but I can't help but believe that a male military veteran wouldn't have had such an embarrassing experience.

Basically, everyone else who has left one, two or three stars has said it all.  Las Vegas to Phoenix Flight 171 on April 17, 2014, I'm stuck here for the next nine hours, despite my early bird check in.  The reason the airline mentioned for this less positive experience is that someone forgot to process the check-ins.  I guess someone woke up one day and decided, oh, I'm not going to do my job today.  I used to always avoid this airline because of the unnecessary and tremendous stress and chaos, but since the assigned numbers in A, B or C, I recently decided to come back.  I'm not so sure after today.  Overall, the low cost and convenient locations cause me to buy from them and the service is adequate.  Fingers crossed for more positive experiences again, in the future.  As for this trip, well, you know how life is sometimes.  Things could always be worse.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I used to fly a lot (like, multiple times a week) and I rarely chose them. Part of it was convenience, part was that I was much more a part of a different loyalty system, but mostly it was about the flying experience. \n\nYou should also know that I don't particularly care for this airport. It's had some work done, so it's getting better again, but overall I'm just not hugely into it. \n\nSo with those two strikes, I actually feel pretty good about being middle of the road about Southwest. I have this theory that Southwest has continually been average, and all the other carriers have been on a steady decline since the whole \"we charge you for baggage\" fees began, and with the advent of discount nickel-and-dine carriers like Allegiant, Frontier, and Spirit, Southwest starts to look good. The only improvement they've really made, however, is assigning you a number with your lettered section. Back in the days of only three boarding groups, it was a nightmare. So, kudos to them.\n\nUnfortunately, I still often have delays coming out of Vegas on Southwest. I've had cancelled flights, delayed flights, and the occasional incident-free flight.\n\nI'm not gonna get to riled up about it, though. It's just a bump in the road, and nothing has been too egregious. The staff here are aplenty and seem competent enough to handle those bumps.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Long gone are the days of \"flying the friendly skies\" and good customer service. With airlines reducing the amount of flights and routes, along with added seats to an already cramped seating area, makes for an uncomfortable ride. \n\nRecently I was in need of a flight to the Miami area, I was checking the flights daily into FLL or MIA, and  was baffled to find there were barely any nonstop flights. I prefer nonstops on long flights, and I have no problem paying extra. Comparing costs and luggage fees, and the fact that SWA had one nonstop leaving first thing in the morning, I grabbed it. \n\nFlight time, 8:50am leaving out of McCarran, as I being dropped off I receive my first text message from SWA announcing a delay to 9:30, ok no big deal. By the time I get to the gate, we are all informed that the flight is now being pushed to 2:05. Thanks to the Polar Vortex and the Snowpocalypse of 2014, most of the flights coming from the East Coast have affected the rest of the travel. It's not SWA fault, and I'm not one of those people who get crazy mad when my flight is delayed due to weather. So I spend my time at the bar, making the best of it. We are finally called to board around 2:30pm, and as I arrive to the counter, I am presented with a $200 credit for future travel with SWA. Wow, that's awesome. It was not their fault for the delays, I thought this was above and beyond.\n\nOn the way to FLL, I noticed that it was taking a lot longer to get there than usual (I'm a clock watcher), and recently I've been experiencing some motion sickness out of the blue. Well the pilot comes on and tells us that he has been circling for the last 1.5 hours due to a closure of both MIA and FLL airports due to a storm and that we are being diverted to Tampa. So we land and we sat at the gate for over 2 hours. I sprint to the lavatory, I won't give details, but I'm not feeling well. When I come out, I asked the stewardness for some water (as I can't brush my teeth with the non potable water in the lavatory) and she says she can't give anything out, I offer to buy it. She denies me. I ask to please be let off the plane so I may get some water, as I was not feeling well. She denies me. At this point I wanted to throw up on her shoes and her non-ironed, looked like it was pulled out of the dirty hamper, uniform.\n\nI sent an email to SWA letting them know what happened. A few days later, I received a CALL, not an email, but a call from a representative expressing his concern for her lack of customer service and letting me know he had filed a complaint against the crew, AND giving me another $200 voucher for future travel. \n\nThis is what customer service is. If something went wrong, they make it right.","useful":7,"funny":2,"cool":7}

If you are lucky enough to fly business,  you can change or cancel your tickets with no penalties. I love that they will call you back if the wait time is too long. The only draw back of course is the unassigned seating,  but I guess you can't have it all especially when your not paying any baggage fees like with American Airlines or other similar ones. I live on Orange County,  so it is convincente that they fly to multiple destinations from there, including our favorite and direct flight to Cabo San Lucas, which is awesome!  Hopefully the other airlines will follow suit and go back to not charging baggage fees, great job Southwest!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

With that said what blew me away this trip was our flight attendant Tolando.  She was on our flight 5\/19\/17 Flight 369 LAS to BNA.  Customer service can make or break a reputation of a company no matter the price of the service.  From the first hello stepping onto the plane she greeted me and everyone with a huge genuine smile.  And her positive energy continued throughout our 3+ hour flight.  She never wavered with her upbeat service to all passengers.  There was something special about her, which I know people may think that's weird to say but it started the tone of our trip and would make my day.  As we exited off the plane I didn't realize I soon would receive a message of a family member passing away while I was in air.  It was almost like she was meant to be there to keep my energy positive and remind me how others can really affect the mood of the day.  Instead of being depressed and sad about the passing of my grandma it was Tolando's positive energy that made me thankful of the wonderful people in my life whether they are family, friends or a complete stranger who had an amazing impact on my day.  If only everyone had a soul like Tolando.  What an amazing employee.","useful":6,"funny":3,"cool":6}

No frills, peanuts and maybe on a long haul cookies or pretzels or cheese crackers, Tip! Pack a lunch if you want something more. Yes you can get it through security. Just don't bring wine or beer. SWA has both and at a reasonable price. \n\nSWA  also has a decent rewards plan so far, plus cheep drinks, free bags, and free wifi now on all their planes with really good stations like the Food Channel. Or the Disney Channel for the children.. Love watching that as I cross the USA. The miss, I may have to go to LA before I can go to Fort Lauderdale with a stop in Atlanta. Never mind all the planes you may have to change to get where you need to go and the fear and angasity that you will go through if the weather is bad or the Harpies conspire so you will miss your connecting flight. \n\nIf you want to serf the net you do need to pay. It's modest compared to other airlines.. but there is a charge. Since everything I have to do by email these days can wait, and I can write my Yelp recommendations off line etc. etc. and my FB people do not need to know what's happening at 35k+ feet I love the free wifi. \n\nSWA however is much more then just shuttling me around. It has been the airlines that has shuttled precious cargo. Ever since I was the Executive Director of the Nevada Diabetes Association way back in 1980 SWA has been flying our kids into Reno from Las Vegas and back home again for our biggest camp for kids with diabetes. Plus for the past 10 years they have flown our kids for Teen Camp too. \n\nIt takes a lot of heart and a lot of cool to handle 40+ kids and 20+ staff who are all  singing camp songs in the back of the plane while having their blood sugars checked and who may have a major medical emergency at a moments notice. Yes we do have medical staff with them. But still there are other passengers who do not know that and SWA has never lost their heart or their cool. \n\nLook, in all honesty flying these days is not a joy. We get packed like sardines into a tin box and pray to the powers that be to keep us safe as we amazingly enough get off the ground. Image that?? We defy gravity!. So.. what makes a difference. The flight attendants, the check in people, the voice on the phone.. Customer services is everything. Plus.. the Pilots . They are really the coolest. If ever they say we are not leaving.. do not argue, they have made a right decision because no matter how long it might take they want you to get to your destination and then home in one piece safe and sound. I trust them with my life every time I fly. \n. \nSWA is my airlines of choice as I travel around these United States. I take them to NYC, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, LV, New Orleans and lots of places. My only problem is if only I could get there without having to go some place else they would be perfect.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":3}

I've never had a problem with my checked in baggage and I know how cruel the ground crew can be (my boyfriend used to work at McCarran and he said the ground crew members would just throw people's baggage around and into the trucks without even caring). The most that was ever done to my bag so far was an inspection and they left me a note to tell me my bag was searched. \n\nOn my first flight to Reno this year, one of the flight attendants started singing on the microphone about what a great flight we've had and how he was glad to have us all on board. It was pretty entertaining and surprising. The flight crew has always been very friendly on all my flights thus far. They give you two bags of peanuts\/pretzels and even more without hesitation if you just ask. On my last flight, I was reading the menu and saw they had a cranberry vodka special for five bucks and monster energy drinks for $3, which I think is pretty decently priced for an airline. \n\nAll in all, I'm sticking to Southwest!","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":6}

They offer great deals most of the time and haven't had an issue with delays more than 10 min.\n\nSure the seats aren't the most comfy but SW is pretty much for travelers who just want to get from point A to point B on a budget.\n\nOf the 8 years I have flown SW, I had only one negative experience, which was resolved in a fair manner. Last weekend, I had to check-in my bag since there was no more room for my carry-on. I never check-in my bags since I have a fear of my bags getting lost. Anyways, so I just decided to go with the flow and of course my biggest fear comes true...my bag gets left behind during my transfer in Oakland. Southwest tried to coordinate to have my bag come in on the last flight at the night. I decided to come in to pick it up since they offered me a $50 credit if I came in. Unfortunately, my bag was not able to make the last flight. At this point I was pretty angry since I had a wedding to attend the following afternoon. However, they made sure they put the bag on priority for the first flight into Las Vegas and offered me another $50 credit. Surely enough, my bag came in early in the morning. Although this was very inconvenient for my family and I, I did appreciate their effort in getting my bag to me and compensating for it. Thanks SW!\n\nCheap, on-time and great customer service + lack of amenities and uncomfortable seats = 3.5 stars","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

No room at all. Really uncomfortable for 5 hours. Flight got in over an hour late too.\n\nOn the way back I again checked in via my phone 24 hours in advance. Got C boarding. Awful. So I paid the $80 ransom once at the airport to get in A boarding. I really don't like this boarding process.

At baggage claim in Columbus, 3 flights of baggage were all coming at the same time to the one carousel. Vegas, Orlando, and Atlanta. Orlando got bags first, we were second. Waited about 45 minutes for bags.\n\nWhy did we have vouchers? Because we were delayed leaving Cancun last year and missed our connection in Atlanta. That was a horrible experience. Will spare the details on the that one...\n\nSo in the last year, I've been on 6 Southwest planes. 4 of these 6 have been delayed at least an hour.

There was hardly any turbulence after they announced it though so that was really lame! They also had no wifi available. They apologized but did not offer anything to make it up to anyone. Such a shady cheap company and this was an expensive little flight!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I rode Northwest all the way to the ground (so to speak). Who would have thought a 50+ year airline would have went out of business, but such is life. \n\nNow, especially since I spend time in the West and Southwest, Southwest airlines are my guys (and gals). I LOVE the computer pre-booking thing that they were one of the originators of, and they have a big presence at most airports so checking your bag at the curb or \"Sky Cab\" is easy and you can just sashay to your gate like a rock star. On a budget.\n\nI especially like the strolling-on-to-the-back-of-the plane-from-the-runway-thing SWA lets you do at Burbank airport. Yes, they let you walk onto your plane from the ground\/runway. Very cool. You gotta try it. \n\nThere's nothing stellar about the planes themselves inside. They're pretty cramped and it's no-frills. No video screens in the back of seats here. But, on the upside, they do have wireless you can purchase (and FREE direct TV the last flight I was on) so it's the perfect scenario to have an IPad\/tablet orgy.\n\nI'm not thrilled with every airport SWA flys into (Vegas), but it's hard to hold them responsible for that. Even though they are no-frills I think they make up for it in consistency, price and the great attitude almost every one of their employees has. They appreciate your business, let you know it and seem like they're having a great time doing their jobs.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Everyone was seated...the luggage bin doors were still all open.  Flight attendants were just about to start the safety briefing.  At a certain point after everyone was seated, the senior flight attendant was standing facing my seat with her arms stretched straight on the edge the luggage bin with her elbows locked.  After about 20 to 30 seconds I sensed she wasn't moving and (as far as I was concerned) had no reason to stand for an extended period of time before take-off with her crotch and lower body in this fashion.  So, I looked up and she was staring (glaring) at me.  Now the way her head was between her arms this would not be apparent to anyone else.  I stared, she stared for about another 20-30 seconds...this does not sound like a very long time.  But just before take-off, it is.  I have no idea what this was about.  If any one does please let me know.  At first I thought she was looking down the front of my shirt\/top.  She had a very distinct look about her.  Long red curly hair with bangs that looked too youthful for her age which was probably about mid 60's.  She had deep furrows between her eyebrows hence the age guess.  \nJust after the pilot did the 2 bells she said\"  Baba Boom,  Bada Bing\"?

We were stunned! After we asked the stewardess several times about getting to the International Terminal, waited for 13 rows to exit before us and ran in street clothes through LAX (for 1.5 miles), we found out that there was a shuttle? A convenient, easy way to start out vacation not in a panic we would miss our flight? \nNot one Southwest person said a single word to us.\nWe fly Southwest all the time. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of communication and service we experienced. That was certainly not a way to start a vacation. I am frankly shocked that not a single person told us that there was an easy way to get to our destination. While the delay out of Las Vegas was unavoidable, the exhausting start to out trip certainly was.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I switched from Delta Airlines since Southwest offers a companion pass (see below for info).  I fly frequently enough to be an A-list preferred member with perks. Overall, I've always had a pleasant experience with Southwest and plan to be fly with them in the future. They've earned my loyalty and are worth a look. \n\nPros: \n\n* Southwest's flyer-friendly policies: No change fees and you get 2 free checked bags (plus free carryons - worth mentioning since now other airlines charge for carryons)\n\n\n* Ding! Fares: Southwest Airlines Offers DING! Fares as low as $49 One-Way. You must sign up for their email alerts and shop for their best Wanna-Get-Away tickets. Their Ding! specials can typically save you anywhere from $5 - $75 bucks one-way (double that savings for your round trip and add in the free check bags ...it's a steal). Ding! Fares require a 14-day advance purchase for the savings so be sure book in advance. They always have the best rates compared to other airlines with their specials. \n\n* Flight Crews:  Majority of their flight crews are professional, engaging, courteous, and friendly. Their safety announcements are light-hearted and funny. They have fun and it shows. Their service is well done with a selection of pop, wine, beer, and juices (beer and mixed drinks are $5 each or free with a reward coupon). You will also be offered a choice of peanuts or pretzels for snacks. On special occasions, you might get lucky with cookies that are shaped like planes or some\nform of Chex mix. \n\n* Outstanding Service: Here are a few examples of where SWA went above and beyond. I've been on a few flights where they have passengers close their windows and turn on their service light to sing happy birthday to a fellow passenger. I even received a complimentary  bottle of champagne and a congratulatory message on our flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico to get married. They saw me carrying my wedding dress and notified the flight crew.  They surprised us and made our trip memorable. \n\n* Companion Pass: This is the benefit that lets you choose one person to fly free with you every time you purchase or redeem points for a flight. You can also sign up for their Chase Visa during their promotion and you can get up to 50,000 points to help you qualify for their companion pass status (after you spend $2,000 on purchases in the first three months your account is open - look at the paperwork). If you like to travel, it's worth it. You can get 2-3 round trip tickets with that 50,000 points if you book it during their sales. I have the card and have been happy with it. There is an annual fee of 99 bucks that includes 6,000 points once you hit your card-anniversary. It's a great perk and you can save a ton of money. \n\n* Free live and on-demand TV: You must bring your own device for viewing (smartphone\/tablet). You can watch live games, HGTV, Bravo and other channels. WiFi will  cost you $8 (free for A-List Preferred Members) \n\n* Rapid Rewards: Sign up for their points program and earn points towards a free flight. Watch their sales to get the most bang for your buck. \n\n* Early Bird Seating: EBS includes automatic check-in, a better boarding position (be seated early on in their general boarding), and access to overhead bin space (since your boarding earlier\/ great for carryon).  This isn't free. It will cost you $15 one way \/ $30 roundtrip. EBS will hook you up with these perks. \n\n* On-time performance:  My experience has been great with being on time. I've had a few times where my flight has been delayed. However, that goes with the territory. \n\n* They'll Make It Right: I've had run-ins with damaged luggage, a rude flight attendant (only twice ... I fly 30+ round trip flights a year for perspective), and oversold flights. I always brought it to their attention and they made it right. They always acknowledged the error and provided compensation\/addressed my concern. It's all about how they handled the situation.  \n\nCons: \n\n* General Boarding: There are no assigned seats. You will be assigned a boarding group (A, B, or C) and position upon check in (offered 24 hrs in advance of your flight- set an alarm to check in). They will have you board according to your assigned number. This is good when you're in A or B. This is not so good when you're in the C group. This is where EBS becomes valuable. Pay the extra 30 bucks and you'll get a decent seat.\n\n\nReview 4 for 2017","useful":17,"funny":9,"cool":13}

All of my clothes were soaked or damp.  I was trying to figure out what happened when I realized that my flight was delayed 2 hrs in Orange County and it was pouring rain....the bags must have been sitting on the runway exposed to the rain.  I didn't mind the clothes getting soaked, but I had 2 textbooks that got damaged.\n\nI promptly called Southwest Airlines and they asked how much they were worth.  I told them I checked on Amazon.com and that the replacement cost was $117 for both books.  They checked on their computer to verify it....once they did, they said \"come on down and we'll write a check for $117\".\n\nThe next day I brought my damaged textbooks to the baggage claim office at the airport and they promptly wrote me a check for $117 after verifying the damaged books.  Awesome!\n\nOne quick tip:  If you fly Southwest and have any issues with your bags, you have 4 hours from the time your flight arrives to report the issue, otherwise you can't file a claim with them.

Let me just say this is a review of southwest as a whole and not individual airports .Here's the story of the travel day from hell. I started off in New Mexico my first flight had been delayed 3 different times even before I had gotten to the airport. Thank goodness for those super helpful flight update texts . Seeing that I wasn't going to be leaving NM till very late at night if ever I decided to change my flight. Apparently that was a really bad move on my part. I arrived at the airport two hours before my flight which was supposed to be boarding at 4:30. Once at my gate I see that my flight is now delayed to 5:10. No big f-ing deal , oh just the small issue of the connecting flight that is supposed to board at 5:20 in Vegas .Surprise surprise we finally land in Vegas at 5:40 and I have to run from gate c7 to gate c25. Not only did the guy give me attitude about me being late he wouldn't let me on the plane even though he let two other people down to the plane. At this point I now have to walk up to the counter to discuss what they are going to do about me missing a flight because one of their other flights made me miss my current one. I seriously lost my shit at the counter and started crying like a big baby. They end up issuing me a new ticket once they figured out it was their fault I missed my connection. I go back down the terminal looking like a wreck and head to my new gate. My new boarding time is 8:25, but guess what ! After sitting at the gate for 10 mins the computer monitor announces that flight is now delayed till 10 . Ok then , fine this is nothing new I guess I'm just going to spend all damn day at the airport. But wait it gets so much better !!! It's just been announced that the flight will be delayed till 10:30. The airplane\nIs siting out on the Tarmac but now we have to wait for a crew . At this point have now told my roommate 5 different times she should pick me up from the Phoenix airport . Oh by the way I'm writing this review while still sitting in the southwest terminal at the gate. It's starting to look like I'm never going to get back to Arizona . I'm seriously wondering what the hell the delays are all about ! As far as I can tell there's no awful weather heading for Phoenix or Las Vegas. Let me just say don't fly this airline , don't waste your money. I could've driven home by now. Lastly Southwest get your shit together this is embarrassing!","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

And this recent trip to New Orleans from Sacramento I got to put the service of Southwest against that of United Airlines. \n\nHere's how they matched up:\n\nPRICE: Southwest is known for being the low fare leader, but when I shopped the other airlines for the \"to\" leg of my trip (Sac to NOLA), United was half what southwest wanted. United actually also came in a few bucks cheaper on the ride home as well, but considering they charge $25 a checked bag and southwest is still free for checked bags, I rode home on southwest.\n\nCOMFORT: I always thought that southwest was the sardine can of airlines but I will correct that myth right here and right now. I didnt have the middle seat on either leg (thank god) but all of the planes I went on were jam packed and southwest still had more leg room over United. I actually am wondering if United shrank their leg room to make way for those annoyingly bright little tvs on the back of the headrests that charge you to watch the news? Hmmm\n\nSERVICE: Southwest wins hands down. Still has the cheeriest flight attendants and the quickest service. If you want a drink (as I often require when I fly) then you wont be waiting long to get one on a Southwest flight :) United flight attendants need a lesson in friendly. On both of my stops (Sac to DC and DC to NOLA) the flight attendants had attitude. Forgive me if I have waited half the flight for a drink of water and I down my 2 oz glass of water like a shot and ask you for another before you move the drink cart another 6 inches down the aisle...is it really necessary to glare at me like I just asked you to let me fly the plane? GAWD I get you are a middle aged flight attendant and your job is clearly rocket science. Please forgive me for needing another 2 oz glass of water.\n\nNo doubt I will pay whatever it takes next time to fly Southwest. No drama, just good service.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I needed a wheelchair and an extra seat to lay in (which I arranged ahead of time).  This experience not only showed several examples of horrific customer service, it also highlighted that this airline does not equip it's planes with general emergency medical equipment.\n\nI have a non-contagious bacterial infection and am taking heavy antibiotics, both of which cause shortness of breath. On the flight to Vegas four days ago I had done all the things wrong and was extremely out of breath when I sat down on the plane. As we were taking off I had an allergy induced asthma attack of sorts, but had no clue what was happening so I started to panic. The kind and wonderful flight attendant brought me oxygen to help calm me down, and 30 minutes later I was fine.\n\nI was seen by multiple physicians in Las Vegas and screened and cleared for a bunch of things that could be causing the extreme fatigue and episodes of shortness of breath. I was cleared to fly, and told I would be completely fine, just use a wheelchair and don't overexert myself before the flight and take some anti-anxiety medication just in case. It would be best if I had two seats to lay down across during the flight.\n\nI called Southwest TWICE to explain the situation, ensure everything would be ok, and to find a non-stop flight that was empty enough where I wouldn't feel bad asking for and extra empty seat on my row. Both Southwest agents were wonderful and kind and explained that would be no problem at all...JUST get a preboard pass and TELL YOUR FLIGHT ATTENDANT WHAT IS GOING ON WHEN YOU BOARD.\n\nThe flight attendant heard one word Daron Clark said ('they brought her OXYGEN on her last flight but we've resolved the issue and she's been cleared to fly.') and cut him off and took off to 'find somebody to see if [we] could fly'. She then told the pilot we needed oxygen while on the flight (not true, and not what he said), and ignored us until another woman came to ask us to step off the flight to discuss the matter. Daron Clark explained that he is one of my physicians and I was more than fine, I just needed to lay down if possible. The pilot lied and said that he didn't make the call, but we have to get off the plane (we were later told by an operations person that it's up to the crew to decide if they feel comfortable transporting a patient, which I completely understand and respect, but why lie to us and pretend it's the powers above?  He then asked if Daron was accusing the flight attendant of lying about my need for oxygen.  Again, Daron tried to explain he was one of my physicians and that I didn't need oxygen, I needed medication (which I had taken) and a wheelchair. While he was speaking the pilot turned around and walked off.\n\nThe desk agent then told us that we 'told them too much' and when we mentioned that I had used oxygen on the plane earlier they stopped listening because they were uncomfortable with us on the flight.\n\nI get it, safety is safety. But this situation was handled HORRIBLY.  If Southwest doesn't fly with oxygen tanks (which as somebody in the medical field understands is crazy on its own) and I need oxygen, then obviously I can't fly Southwest. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. The flight attendant saw a sick girl in a wheelchair and heard 'oxygen' in the beginning of the back story and freaked out. She didn't stop to ask, or think, or treat me as anything other than a hazard that needed to be removed and that she didn't want to deal with.  She did not even tell me they didn't have oxygen, she avoided eye contact and refused to speak with me.\n\nAnd side note, WHY DO THEY NOT HAVE OXYGEN ON BOARD FOR EMERGENCIES???\n\nThey put me on another Southwest flight for the following day, with instructions not to mention anything next time so I don't make the flight attendants uncomfortable. \n\nOnly after we left did we notice the paperwork (A NON DISCRIMINATION FORM) that they made Daron sign (they told him it was a DOT form and that it must be signed) had a line where they had added, 'passenger stated that they needed oxygen during the flight.'\n\nUnbelievable.  And completely unacceptable for a company so focused on safety and heartfelt customer service.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

First of all, my flight was delayed over an hour at the Oakland Airport. We finally started boarding, and they ran out of room on the plane (I was one of the last to board) so they the remaining passengers check our bags outside of the plane door. I meant to carry my luggage onto the plane to make things easier and avoid baggage claim once I got to Vegas, but oh well!\n\nWe had a layover in San Diego, which took a while, but wasn't too inconvenient. At least I didn't have to switch planes! Once we took off for Vegas, they started taking drink orders, but it took them so long to bring out the drinks that half of the plane (including me) never got our drinks because we had already arrived in Vegas! I was pretty disappointed, but at least I had arrived!\n\nI called up my sister and friend, who drove over to the airport to get me. But, to my dismay, my luggage was NOWHERE to be found. I waited at baggage claim for 2 flights worth of luggage to pass, asked around, and then found myself in an extremely long line of other people who could also not locate their bags. In total, the line took over an hour to get through. I asked my sister to go back to the hotel without me. At the end, they made me file a lost luggage report, and said the would cover $50 of necessities (I literally was left with nothing for my trip). They said they were pretty sure they'd find it that night or the next morning and would deliver it to my hotel.\n\nEveryday they called me to say my luggage still had not been found.\n\nMy trip came and went. I was pretty sad about losing my luggage, clothes, makeup, and jewelry. A few days later, around 8pm, I got a random call from Oakland airport. The girl sounded really confused, said she found a bag with my name on it, and asked if I had flown anywhere recently. I told her, \"Yeah I was in Vegas a few days ago and my luggage never arrived. I filed a report, and Southwest was supposed to be looking for it.\" After I told her that she was still confused, but was eventually able to look up my lost luggage report on their system. So basically, they just randomly found my bag - they were NOT looking for it. \n\nThe only good part is that they delivered my bag to my house that night!!!! I was so happy to get all my stuff back, but pretty disappointed with my experience.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They'll give it to you, it might be empty but hey it could have been full!\n\nAny physics nerd out here?  *Raises hand*  If someone attempts to open the door in mid-flight do this:  *Raise both middle fingers*  And leave them alone because e=mc2.  It's impossible for that door to be opened, so watch that loser get tired then give him an elbow drop from the top seat turnbuckle.  \n\nIf you have kids and they really want to see the cockpit, wait until the end after everyone gets out and then ask the pilot, they'll have all the time in the world to let them or you check it out.  Ladies, you might even be able to sit on their lap.  \n\nDon't use anything from the crew unless it's wrapped in plastic, you don't want to use old blankets and towels.  And anything in the pocket in front of you too like magazines and shit, those are old and collect dirt, filth, cooties.  Buy a magazine and use that.\n\nGirls know that moisturizing trick about dead air and lotion to keep your skin hydrated or something, go ask them about it.  \n\nOh and one more, there's a way to open a locked door from the outside, so when your friends go to use the toilet you can troll them.  The way to open it, wait.. perverts might be reading this.  Message me and I'll tell you how.\n\nAnyone wanna have a UYE plane trip ride when they have their $1 flights let me know, I'm down!","useful":2,"funny":11,"cool":4}

My group and I arrived to the gate an hour early and proceeded to line up when it was time to board. We were line numbers 36-39 and waited until everyone in front of us walked onto the plan. Then we walked up to NATHAN who was the rudest minimum wage  ticket beeper I have ever met. As we walked up to him he immediately said \"back up and wait your turn, you are not allowed on the plane yet\" in the most snappy attitude I've ever seen from someone that worked at an airport. He said this even though there was nobody in front of us. So we stepped back and my pregnant girlfriend made a comment to one of our other friends saying \"that was really rude, I've never been treated like that before\". NATHAN overheard the comment and chimed in saying \"Well that is SOUTHWEST policy and if you've never been treated like that before then I'm going to call all the SOUTHWESTS and make sure you're treated the same way\". That kind of irritated me so I said \"Sir I don't know what your issue is, all we are saying is we have never had service like this before\" NATHAN then said \"Sir according to FAA regulations you cant bring vodka on the plane\". I was drinking a cup of WATER from WENDYS. Next NATHAN said \"Will the 4 of you please step to the side I'm going to have security meet with you for INTOXICATION\". RIDICULOUS we hadn't had any alcohol that day and to TOP IT OFF he lied to security and said we were drinking in the gate! What BULLSHIT. FINALLY 2  SECURITY members came and agreed we were NOT intoxicated whatsoever and tried to argue with NATHAN to let us on the plane. He walked away into the plane and the plane LEFT! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE SECURITY FELT BAD FOR US AND GAVE US $20 FOR THE AWFUL EXPERIENCE. WE WERE STUCK IN LAS VEGAS FOR 9 HOURS WITH NO COMPENSATION FOR THE RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL AND VULGAR BEHAVIOR FROM YOUR EMPLOYEE. I WILL NEVER FLY WITH YOUR AIRLINE AGAIN AND I WILL BE WRITING REVIEWS ON EVERY POSSIBLE SITE KNOWN TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE.

Her thoughtlessness and curt attitude makes her stand out in what is generally a great flying experience. \nThe boring particulars of what led to being so close and yet so far from making my scheduled flight follow. The rental car shuttle took 15 min. to arrive with a drop off not at the departure area. Upon arrival a longer than usual line for baggage check-in greeted me, complete with a traveling group of hearing impaired minors. The departure check-in agent informed me that I was now a mere 25 min. ahead of departure and to proceed quickly to my flight, concourse B, gate 20. However, she failed to say that ALL pre-checked TSA agents are on concourse A and that I could get to B concourse after clearing TSA in concourse A; that concourse A connects with B after the TSA check is not obvious and the signage confusing. Valuable time was lost going through the regular TSA checkpoint. Of course B20 was the next to last gate on the B concourse and one of two moving walkways was not moving going toward my destination. Moving rapidly I believed I'd made it with minutes to spare only to be told that Alison had decided to close the door just before I arrived even though the flight departure time had not yet been reached. Alison informed me that she was authorized to close the door 10 min. ahead of the departure time and she'd not closed it even that early. It was she who then began to look at other options to get me to my final destination. Her informing me that everything was full and getting me home without my paying to hold a spot on another flight was infuriating. She said that she was aware that the airport was unusually busy that morning. Somehow that knowledge didn't factor into her early door-closing decision. She wasn't rude, but curt and blaming would be accurate descriptions of her demeanor. My struggles and consequent inconvenience appeared unimportant to her. As it happened, the alternate flight I got on had a passenger who realized that he had somehow left his wallet somewhere in the airport, possibly at TSA. This flight delayed closing their door for approximately 10 min. after the last boarding call as a decision was being made whether to proceed without said wallet or to deplane and catch a later flight (He decided to go walletless) demonstrating that some discretion is possible regarding when to officially close and lock the airplane door.

It's by far my favorite airline, and I try to use them whenever I fly anywhere they have flights. But let me tell you why I love them so!\n\nFirst of all, I love their fare sales. There are times when I had no intention of flying home (from LAS to BUR) for a particular weekend. But then they have a fare sale, and the flights go from about 220 RT to about 120. That's substantially cheaper than driving my vehicle to BUR and back, so I end up flying out. \n\nSecond, I like their service. They've always been good and professional and nice when I've flown with them, so I have no cause to criticize. Even when I've BARELY made it to the terminal on time, they've been great about helping me. They're good people. \n\nThird, I like how their boarding process works. I like that it's more \"first come first served\" than the traditional \"here's your ticket\/system\" system that most other companies use. So that's cool, too. \n\nFourth, all that together creates really good synergy. I love it.

They pack you in there like cattle. Which is why I usually fly US Airways - since we have the credit card we usually have enough points for a upgrade to First Class. Southwest does not have a First Class so they treat everyone equally which can be good or bad depending on your point of view. The staff is usually pretty efficient and hard-working though not always very friendly.\n\nThey have a couple policies which set them apart in a good way and so these are the reason I am giving them three stars even though I had to wait two hours on my last trip due to a delay that was not weather related or mechanical (they decided at the last minute to cancel my flight since it wasn't full enough). First off, they do let you check a bag for free. I hate it that the other airlines have started charging for this because it means that now everyone tries to carry all their stuff onto the plane which causes huge delays for everyone while boarding and exiting the plane. Second benefit of Southwest is that they have no change fees. This makes it the best option when your travel plans are not firm. Of course if you change at the last minute and the new flight is more expensive then you might still have to pay. But I like it that there is no additional service charge to do so. The other thing that Southwest is known for is of course their lack of assigned seats. This is great when you are traveling alone but it can be a hassle when traveling with other people.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

(And why put this in public view, where irate passengers can see how badly they drop the ball?) They called on a radio to ask what was going on, then there was an announcement that they were so sorry for the delay, but a load of freight was removed from our flight before the luggage and our bags were coming soon.  Why??? Why did anyone at  Southwest think it was OK for passengers to wait for over an hours - who have already been delayed over 1.5 hours - for their luggage? Ten more minutes and nothing; even the belt stopped moving.  Back to the baggage office to complain again.  Same clueless employee still had no information other than \"coming momentarily\".

This is the case with me upping Southwest Airlines from a poor to good rating.\n\n   I have been flying with Southwest Airlines for years. Lately, what was once a hip and reputable airline had taken a nosedive toward becoming like Spirit Airlines. My last couple of experiences with Southwest Airlines were unpleasant. Last year on a flight bound for Vegas, Southwest Airlines lost our luggage. A couple of hours later they'd find it, and deliver the luggage to us with a $50 complimentary ticket. I was not impressed with the manner in which their baggage agents handled the situation. They were uninterested, and there was no urgency. Fast forward to the flights from Midway. My dad's flight got delayed three hours. Southwest Agents were out of the loop to what was causing the delay. The cause was a mechanical problem. When they bring a replacement airplane, there is another delay. And on my brother's and my flight, there was another delay. Lining up to board the airplane is a hassle. Southwest separates their passengers into three groups from A to C. Of course, we'd be in the C group causing us to be the last to get on the plane. Let me say that it is not an enjoyable experience to have to fly over the country between strangers, especially when they are unpleasant.\n\n   Southwest Airlines has a weapon that is underutilized in business. It is a sense of humor. Unfortunately the humorous flight crews are being utilized less. Flying back from Chicago we were fortunate to have a humorous flight crew. Their jokes diffused a tense environment. Passengers who entered the plane tense and miserable left smiling and relaxed. I was one passenger. \n\n  Another thing I like about Southwest, that would always keep my rating of 2 or higher, is sufficient human beings at the ticket counter. I HATE when airlines replace human ticket agents with machines. And this has happened to me at the so-called premium airlines like Delta.\n\n   Southwest Airlines is an example of a business utilizing employees with a good sense of humor to achieve a favorable impression with customers. It worked with me.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They never earn more than three stars though because while their employees are often very nice, the company really couldn't care less about you.  So fly them for value, but don't fly them for experience or customer service.\n\nThen comes the mighty McCarran International.  I don't really care whose fault it is, but the seating situation in the Southwest terminal is atrocious, and, in typical Southwest fashion, they don't give a sh*t.  Just walk through terminal C and at every single gate with a flight departing in less than an hour you'll see 20 to 30 people sitting on the ground.  It has been this way for years.  Do they do anything about it?  No.  All the eating options are generally out of seats as well.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Southwest only scans luggage at the origin, so if your bag disappears somewhere between McCarran and where you came form, or someone steals it off the belt at McCarran, they will never know.  I had luggage stolen in 2012 and even after my wife and I tracked the luggage down via the second hand clothing store where the thieves tried to sell it, tracked the thieves down and got them arrested, Southwest was still calling me to let me know they were looking for the missing bag.\n\nSouthwest, if you're listening, go buy some f'ing chairs and stick them in the terminal.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

What a JOKE!  After being on hold for over ONE HOUR on two separate lines on another day, then today on hold for over 20 minutes, I finally get a rep (Cindy) to answer.  I am trying to extend a credit that will be expiring on 12\/9\/15.  First, this rep can't even find my credit.  She puts me on hold three times and comes back each time with some excuse (the confirmation # is wrong, can't find it, maybe it's with our vacations dept, etc.)  Finally after the 4th hold, she comes back and says she found it...really?  Now here's the kicker...they can't extend it until the credit expires.  WHAT?  It's expiring in two days.  Nope can't do it.  BUT, here's a new confirmation # to use so that the next rep can find this needle in a haystack.  I then ask if there's a better number so that the 20 min to ONE HOUR wait can be bypassed...of course not.\n\nI have been traveling with SW for a very long time, and although it's not the best customer service (what do you expect for cheap flights), this is by far the worst experience in a long time.  There was a time that I flew so much, I would get points, and flights, and whatever.  Perhaps now that I don't fly as much, I'm not as valued as before.  \n\nI do agree with some of the recent posts of rude airline crews, and even counter employees.  I will continue to use SW because of affordability, but won't expect anything better.  That way there's no disappointment.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But my flight home from LAS to TPA this week left me hoping another airline steps up with a non-stop on this route before my next trip in May. In-flight service is so hit or miss, and it seems to not be improving.\n\nFirst, boarding was delayed more than 20 minutes. We were told we were waiting on a flight attendant. I really appreciated knowing why, but now I have a few follow-up questions. Ultimately, we ended up pulling away from the gate about 30 minutes late, which made our arrival time in Tampa well after midnight. \n\nAfter we boarded, my colleague noticed immediately that he couldn't connect to the WiFi. Neither could I, but other passengers were still boarding, so we assumed (hoped) it hadn't been turned on yet. Because my colleague was adamant about watching the Yankees playoff game, he had checked Southwest.com the night prior to confirm our flight had WiFi. He'd actually told me he would be changing his flight if WiFi was not available. Unfortunately, as the flight attendant made the usual pre-flight safety announcements, she mentioned we were on one of their brand new, just-delivered Boeing 737 Max planes... and the WiFi had not yet been installed. My colleague was beyond upset. As for myself, I hadn't downloaded any media because I expected to pay for & enjoy the WiFi. So I was also rather disappointed. \n\nTo make matters worse, for me, when I'm bored, I'd like to drink. However, the flight attendants only made one round through the cabin offering drinks, and instead spent most of the flight in the galley chit-chatting with each other. On a 4+ hour flight, I'm not sure why they thought everyone would be content with one beverage. \n\nOverall, my flight from LAS to TPA was smooth, and the pilot made up a little time in the air. But the service was so lacking on this flight that I am definitely going to weigh my options for my next flight to Vegas. A layover might be worthwhile to not have to deal with the cattle-herding that Southwest always feels like.","useful":10,"funny":5,"cool":5}

Within minutes, my suitcase comes down the chute. One down, one to go. Then I see a hanging bag that looks like mine come down the chute. But some older guy picks it up. I thought about going over and asking to see the id tag, but was embarrassed to do so, so I didn't. Ten minutes later, all the bags are gone from the carousel except a hanging bag that isn't mine. So I headed to the Southwest help desk where I met the most enthusiastic airline employee I've ever met. Her name is Cari Lynn, and if you ever lose a bag in the Las Vegas airport, hope and pray that she's the one you get to talk to. After explaining that I thought my bag might have been picked up by mistake, she told me that you should never be embarrassed to walk up to someone and ask to check an id tag. She made some phone calls, checked some stuff on the computer, then made a report. She took down my phone number and which hotel I was staying at then told me they'd let me know as soon as they found out something. By now, it's been about an hour since I got off the plane. So with nothing left for me to do but wait, I got in a cab and left. The cab probably wasn't two miles from the airport when my phone rang. It was Cari Lynn calling to say that my bag turned up. She offered to meet me out on the curb so I didn't have to come back inside. Sure enough, she was waiting there when we pulled up. \nI gave her a big hug. \nConsidering that I've been flying on Southwest since I was in elementary school and never had a bad experience, I don't think it would be fair to deduct stars for one bag getting lost.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We had taken both of our girls car seats with us and on the way back one of the seat cushions had been lost in baggage. My wife went in to speak to one of the managers but she had stated in the end that there was nothing that she could do. Furious I went back in and spoke to the same manager and having some words for her she magically said there can be something done. But my argument is that why does it have to come down to that? Just take care of the customer in the first place.\n\nAfterwards I spoke to one of the counter reps where they submitted an incident report on my behalf. The problem that I explained to them was that I could not just buy a car seat cushion separately but had to buy the whole car seat again which cost $40.\n\nSo after going to their bag claim website, submitting all the required documents and filing the claim I waited. It states that it could take up to 30 days for a response.\n\nAfter waiting a month I called back their baggage central number and this is when it got better. I spoke to a rep named Tiffany who was very accommodating. She stated at first that I may have to wait for her manager to take care of this issue but shortly after she said she would just take care of the issue. She gave me a choice of obtaining a $40 check or a $100 southwest voucher. I was very pleased to hear that she took on the responsibility and took care of a customer.

That has to have been the BEST pizza I've ever had. We ordered two pizzas, one margarita and one with sun dried tomatoes, sausage, and meatballs. Both were spectacular. The crust was thin and crispy, with just the right amount of sauce to cheese ratio. The toppings tasted extremely fresh and the pizza was not oily. I'm one of those people who dab the pizza with a napkin if I see oil on it, but this time I didn't have to! They use a coal oven to cook their pizzas, which results in a very crispy crust. I heard they take Las Vegas water, purify it, and turn it in to the same composition as NY water for their pizza dough. I'm not sure if that's their secret or the oven, but it was delicious! \n\nAfter eating tons of pizza we were stuffed but....we decided to order dessert! And boy, were we not disappointed. We split a cannoli and yum it was delicious. The exterior shell was crisp, as if it was just stuffed! The filling was creamy and sweet, but not too sweet. The atmosphere was very pleasant, and the service was wonderful and attentive. The parking was also great. Since it's in a shopping mall area, there are a ton of spots. Plus, after eating about half a large pizza each (8 big slices in a large pizza) we were able to go shopping!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

After some serious shopping at the only Nordstrom Rack in the entire Las Vegas\/ Henderson we finally got a chance to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nThey weren't very busy but we came around 2pm on Sunday, between lunch and dinner.  I like the outdoor area with the bar, they also had the games on but some guy was smoking a strong cigar so we opted to go inside.  They seated us right away but our server didn't even come around until 5 minutes later so I already thought we made a bad choice.  But our waitress was very helpful especially after we told her it was our first time.  The small salads can serve up to 2 people and are all made with a red wine vinaigrette except the Caesar salad.  They have set prices for plain cheese pizza with different sauces and sizes and additional toppings are about $2 each.\n\nWe ordered a small house salad- lettuce,red peppers, mushrooms green olives and red onion. There was a lot of dressing but thats the way I like it!  We also ordered a small red sauce pizza with fresh garlic, ricotta and Italian sausage.  When it arrived they stretched it to a large! This was the best pizza we've had in Vegas- ricotta was very creamy and they didn't hold back on the toppings.  Overall we spend just about $30.  We will definitely go back when we are on this side of town since I heard the Summerlin one just isn't as good.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

As a frequent customer to your 9595 S. Eastern Avenue location I was appalled by our experience on Sat. 8\/22\/15 at approx. 7:30 p.m. There was a table of 3 men and a woman. One man was drunk and disorderly. So much so, that a nearby table of adults with young children cancelled their order and left because of their foul language. Myself and my guest were likewise offended. One of the men at the table was permitted to enter and dine in bare feet, which was repulsive. \n\nI called for the manager to ask that he take appropriate action. His comment was \"I've already spoken to them and there was nothing more I could do.\" I mentioned to him about the man being permitted to dine in bare feet and that being a health issue and potentially liability should he step on glass or other foreign matter. He just shrugged his shoulders and said \"I'm sorry.\" \n\nThis manager was approximately 6'3\" and 250 lbs. and seemed frightened to confront and order them to leave. I heard from some of the other dinners and they too were appalled and disgusted that the \"manager\" just let these unruly persons ruin their dinner as well. This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had and will think twice before returning to that location.","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":3}

I'm posting a photo of the pizza. See if you can find the sausage. I think there is more sausage on McDonald's sausage biscuit sandwich. I can here Clara Peller yelling \"where's the beef\" from her grave. 5. The only reason that I'm able to give this place a star, is because the pizza was in fact very tasty. The sausage was very good when you could find a bite. Good sauce and fresh peppers.   I will probably try them again and order double sausage.

PEOPLE IT\"S THIN CRUST PIZZA.  If you don't like thin crust then stay away from this place.  It's also COAL FIRED OVEN.  If you don't understand this,, the coal heats at a higher temperature than fire or other means leaving this thin crust cooked crisp with a few chars here and there.  Anyway, I dislike thick crust pizzas because my opinion is the crust can absorb\/take away from the flavors on the pizza.  When Grimaldis opened (I actually was a subcontractor for part of the building so I was aware as it was coming into town) I decided to try and I absolutely think it's the best pizza in Vegas minus specialty gourmet pizzas which I give to Metro. The crust in my opinion is great, the fire roasted pepper yummy, the thick pepperoni, sausage extremely flavorful, And get this ,, the few people in here complaining about the cheese IT\"S WHOLE SLICED MOZZARELLA.  I don't know if you understand that when a pizza place uses pre shredded cheese it looses some flavor as it has to be preserved  and prevented from hardening and sticking together.  The whole slices of cheese on Grimaldis pizza adds a great effect and provides in my opinion the best flavor the cheese can offer. If you want piles of shredded cheese that starts stretching and stringing as you have to keep pulling it away from you as you try to eat then you won't like Grimaldis.  Basically, IT's all about proportions.  I think Grimaldis has found the best, crust,cheese, sauce proportion for me. I can taste everything without getting full on the first slice.  Also, sign up for their email and get a free large pizza every year for your Birthday,, it's a great deal LOL.\nIf you decide Grimaldis doesn't have the toppings you desire then there's only one other place in vegas and that is Metro.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This is some tasty pizza and highly customizable, great for splitting with friends. Lots of selection if you don't happen to be in the mood for a triangular piece of heaven. \n\nI've been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. The slightly crunchy thin crust pizza is cooked perfectly each time; it's great but not super filling or overwhelming like some pizza can be. From peppers to pineapple they have any topping you desire. They use fresh mozzarella on the pizza so it's not oozing with a thick layer of cheese (a positive in my book), rather there are spots of cheese all around the pizza. The salads are enormous and wonderful. My favorite is the Caprese. You'll definitely want to share one of those bad boys. \n\nThe outdoor seating is awesome when the weather is right and the indoor seating feels like an Italian grandmother's kitchen, dough flying through the air and pizza ovens hard at work.

The first time I went I ordered my pizza with light sauce,   when my pizza arrived it had sauce oozing all over it.  The server was quite apologetic and offered me something else or to have the pizza remade, but I was with others and I didn't want to make them wait so I just opted to not eat.\n\nSo round two with this this place was even more traumatizing!   We arrived to wait for hostess to come up front because she was yakking it up with  the servers by the kitchen area.   We were seated in a little side room where we were pretty much ignored but I did get a good feel for the atmosphere.  After about 10 mins, waiting Server #1 strolled by and asked if we had been helped.   He gave me his name and took our drink and food order.  I once again mentioned I wanted light sauce on the pizza, no onions in my salad, and just a water w\/lemon to drink.  Someone else brought our drinks and there was no lemon in the water so I asked Server # 2 for the lemon and he assured me he would bring back.  That never happened because a 3rd server brought our salads.   The salad was full of onions and so I did not eat it.  It sat on the edge of our table for about another 15mins until a 4th server brought our pizza.   The pizza was made correctly so I took a chance and asked this server for the lemon which he did return with and I gave him the salad and asked that he remove it from the bill because I couldn't eat it.\n\nThrough the meal no other servers ever checked on us.  In fact I had to flag down one just to get my daughter a drink refill.  The place was not very busy but yet all the Servers were clustered either by the kitchen or bar and everyone was laughing and joking amongst themselves, at one point I noted one Server swinging between the two counter areas.   I had to flag someone down again to get my pizza boxed and get my check.   I waited another 10 mins and no one ever came to get my check so I finally was annoyed and took the check to the front where once again the hostess was standing holding the front door open and chatting w\/another employee and not at the hostess area.   \n\nI usually leave at 20% tip at most places because I do understand how hard Servers work as I used to work for a restaurant company, but this time the only tip I left was a note on the check stating they needed to improve their customer service.   As for the food it's mediocre at best, nothing really stands out about it, so I most definitely will not give them a third chance.  Their customer service ruined it completely for me.  :(","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":2}

I grew up 1 block over from Little Italy and 3 blocks from Lombardi's.  I love italian food.\n\nI love the thin crust, crispy, saucey, cheesey variety.  Grimaldi's in NYC is better than Vegas.  Pizza in NYC generally speaking tastes different than anywhere else.  Most pizzeria owners that I know back home, say its the water that makes it taste different, and I actually have to agree.  \n\nGrimaldi's here make a great effort in providing NYC Style pizza.  The gf and I had a large pie with sweet red peppers, sausage and onions.  It's thin and crispy.  Saucey and cheesey however, it is not!  Seemed like they skimped on the sauce (which is their signature) and the cheese.  Especially, when the sauce and cheese are the main components of the pizza.  It was good, but not great.  Sadly, I left here unimpressed and missing NY a little more.\n\nAtmosphere was good, they have an outdoor patio and full bar with a few flatscreens to watch the games.\n\nHeard Giovanni's is better.

If it is made of bread, cheese and tomato sauce i am there, and i am one happy woman!!\n\nBut the pizzas at Grimaldi's well you could prop me up at the bar and keep feeding me slices of heaven until i burst like Mr Creosote (Monty Python reference there kids!!) I ordered a large (tomato sauce) pizza with mushrooms, fresh chopped tomatoes, roasted sweet red peppers and garlic...no meat for me folks sorry!! Also a caprasie (also known as a tri-colour) salad for an appetizer and a small house salad to go with my pizza.\n\nThe Caprasie salad ($7) was perfect to share and came with the dinkiest pieces of bread to top with basil, Roma tomatoes and home made mozzarella..yummy! The small house salad ($5) was again more than enough to share between two people and really complimented the pizza, the salad dressing was flavorful but didn't over power the dish.\n\n\nAnd now we get to may favorite part the pizza, like i said i love pizzas, but this one has topped my charts! The base was beautifully cooked, it was a good thin crust hand tossed kinda base, but it was still soft and amazingly fresh tasting. They had amazingly managed to make it completely uncracker like which most wood\/coal fired pizza places seem to make their bases. The \"secret\" tomato sauce was sweet with just the right amount of herbs, not over powering that it makes your eyes water, but with a damn good flavour! The toppings...well the mushrooms were beautiful, not gritty and not so small that you couldn't find them; the fresh tomatoes were sweet and juicy, the sweet red peppers...oh my god they were amazing a slight spicy flavour enhanced by the sweet roasted yumminess of the peppers! Lastly the garlic, wow wee it's a good thing I'm sitting here by myself as wow i can still taste the garlic and it's been a loooooong time since i ate it!\n\nWell all in all it was a great experience, the total bill came to $50, and this included a half carafe of pg and 2 large glasses or Perioni beer.\n\nSo the down side, yes it did take FOREVER for the food to get served, yes the wait staff was not the jolliest i have ever encountered.....but for me the food totally makes up for it! \n\nSo on my recommendation, go to Grimaldi's order the pizza, salad, beer or wine...and just remember to carry a book and a bag of pretzels to tie you over until the really food comes out, because ladies and gentlemen it is totally worth waiting for!","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

My husband recently had his wisdom teeth pulled, so we were hoping to find some pasta instead of just pizza. Unfortunately, it was only a pizza place, but it smelled good so we stayed. We ordered the caprese appetizer. It came with tomatoes that were hard and unripe. The cheese and basil were good, but the server brought the oil and vinegar, instead of it having any type of balsamic vinaigrette for dressing. We asked for it, but she seemed perplexed. Finally got that. Ordered a 16-inch pizza (they come with a thin crust) with onions and mushrooms. The pizza arrived quickly, probably because it was undercooked. We were surprised to see the crust on the outside was done, but underneath the toppings, the dough was raw. The mushrooms had zero flavor, as did the sauce, and the cheese was minimal and also flavorless. The onions were cut in too large pieces, and also seemed to have zero taste. We showed our server that it wasn't done, and she said it's because of the mushrooms. Really? I have mushrooms on pizza all the time, and the dough is never raw. I'm also kind of amazed she didn't tell a manger to come to our table who might address the issue. The server was nice, but might have been new because she was kind of clueless.\n\nAte some of the toppings but left all the crust. We ordered the blueberry cheesecake for dessert, and it was actually good.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back here. Joey's pizza up the hill on Eastern is WAY better, or just go to Pizza Rev where you can get exactly what you want for a great price and taste. \n\nNot sure how this place got such good reviews on Yelp.\n\n\nNOTE: I was contacted by the manager regarding our bad experience and was offered complimentary meals to try again, which we will do in the future. I won't amend this review yet. When I try it again, I will keep you posted. I will give the management credit for responding quickly and more than appropriately.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It is quite pricey to get the perfect pizza. Which is probably what I got. We got a tip from the local to get extra sauce, extra cheese, and fresh garlic. I'll tell you right now each of those items are 2$ a piece. Me and 3 other friends got a large which I think is an 18\" pizza, we all picked a topping and added the 3 mentioned above, one already being my friend's aloof choice, one added mushroom, another added pepporoni, and I added ricotta cheese (which I think helped make the pizza that good hehe). The pizza itself was 16$ I think, but add 12$ in added-ons, and there ya go 28$ but it was pretty damn good. I have to honestly say it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.

It is the fact that it's become a melting pot to some of the nation's best food.  Next door you'll find a frozen custard place imported from Utah.  You could also find some of the most popular burger places from NYC and Cali.  But what got me excited was the fact that at Grimaldi's, I could have New York's best pizza on the west coast!\n\nIn Vegas they actually have three locations.  I chose this location because of its proximity to my hotel and because of it's late hours (it closed at midnight on Saturday night).\n\nWhat I loved about Grimaldi's in New York was its amazing crust, is fresh tomato sauce, and its fresh ingredients.  It was just perfect.\n\nFor my visit to this Vegas location, I ordered a Margherita pizza with garlic and  a pesto pizza with chicken and tomato.  Both pizzas were winners.  I love the pizza dough - it's chewy and it has a nice sweet flavor.  The margherita is a personal favorite of mine - I just love the simple flavor and the perfect balance of the tomato sauce, cheese, and basil.\n\nMy only gripe is that the pizza was that I felt that the crust could have been cooked a little more.   I can't really tell you with certainty how this compares to NYC, but I can tell you with certainty that I was so glad to have some legit NY pizza on the west coast.  Definitely give Grimaldi's a shot if you're not able to go to Brooklyn.

This kind of pizza, large, floppy and often sold by the slice has been imitated in one way or another in every corner of the country to mixed results.  \n\nBut there is another sort of New York pizza that predates the style most (New Yorkers included) are familiar with. It's the kind of pizza made in a small handful of ancient pizzerias in New York city like Lomardi's, Grimaldi's and Totono's. It's thin crusted with a sweet tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan and\/or romano, some dried oregano and fresh basil and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Mozzarella is used sparingly, about half as much as you'd expect. This is the style of the very first pizzas made in America by Neapolitan immigrants.  The distinguishing factor today is the once-common coal-fired brick oven running about 900 degrees that's capable of charring the crust before it browns the cheese.  The result is a striking palette of black, light brown, white, dark green and about five shades of red.\n\nI've never been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but I have been to Totono's. And this style, the so-called New York Neapolitan, was one I thought I could only score in NYC.  Through the magic of Yelp, I found this improbable outpost while looking for a hassle-free, off the strip locale for a family dinner. Problem is, I talk too much and felt the need to find a real gem.  This couldn't have been easier.  I was shocked to see that NYC's favorite pizzeria had franchised, but this looks like a small chain run by a nephew of the original owner, with his blessings, assistance and recipes.  \n\nWe were quickly seated through the help of a call-ahead quasi-reservation at the best table in the house, right next to the pizza prep station.  The pies were nearly flawless.  I went with extra basil and I sampled the pepperoni and sausage. There were six of us, all northeast natives, two of which have lived in Italy, and all of us ranked this as our favorite or near-favorite pizza ever.  Is it my favorite?  I'm not sure, but it's 2nd or third at worst.  It has to be the best in Vegas and it will be a mandatory stop every time I'm in town.\n\nThey don't have a line out the door yet, so check it out before the word spreads.

Coal ovens might have been the thing back in the early days and they are experiencing a bit of a renaissance with Grimaldi's and others, but modern NY pizza comes out of normal ovens, has oregano already on the slice, has that droopy tip and also that small layer of grease drips onto your paper plate. That being said, GRimaldi's is one of the best gourmet pizza's in town and I guess the country now. At $20 a pizza that's the category it belongs in, but the staff is very friendly and the large meatball pie I consumed at the bar was hot, fresh and excellent. I hope when this place has 80 restaurants the quality will remain the same. It's sad to see another good place turn into a monster chain, but greed rules these days and this joint could turn into a Chili's of Pizza someday - I hope not.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Generally, I dislike going to any restaurant located inside a hotel on the strip because the traffic, parking, and combined walking distance is inconvenient.  The Palazzo is a nice higher end hotel so going here made it a bit more tolerable.  The restaurant itself lets you feel like you are having dinner outside, this was nice.  \n\nWe ordered the antipasto, spinach salad, and The Don pizza (pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs).  The thin crust pizza is cooked under intense heat for a short time in their brick oven, to me it tastes like your standard Napoli style pizza - they're okay but I don't like the way the crust is always burnt.  If you're a fan of Chicago style pan pizza then this place may not be for you.  My wife on the other hand just loved it and said it was the best pizza she ever had.  It was good - tangy tomato sauce, melted cheese, and that slightly salted meat taste hit the spot.  We also enjoyed the spinach salad because it came with other healthy stuff like crispy bacon and Gorgonzola cheese.   The antipasto was good as well - hard to go wrong with cold cuts, sliced cheese, olives, and jarred red peppers on a plate.  This paired well with their bread, olive oil, and vinegar for dipping.  I later learned that this restaurant is available in 5 other locations, we'll be sure to bookmark the locations off the strip the next time we are in Las Vegas.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I could literally count all the sausage toppings and mushrooms were just as sparse. For a place that charges by the topping, we felt ripped off! \nService wasn't that much better. The table nearby had more food and drinks and could tell they got better service the entire time because of it. Ridiculous for the party of two! \nBy the time we are almost half the pizza, it became rubbery and impossible to cut with a fork and knife, bleh!

Luckily there were a couple of open tables for us, since we didn't have a reservation, which I would recommend if you don't get there early because the line of people waiting for tables got longer and longer while we were there enjoying our meal. In fact when we left around 8pm, there was still a line.\n\nWe started with your standard pepperoni and sausage pizza, and then we ordered a specialty white pizza (I can't remember the name), which is supposed to taste like a cheese steak. I liked the pepperoni and sausage pizza better than the specialty one. Although it did taste pretty good, I think that there was way too much cheese on top and it made the pizza taste a little dry and marshmallow-y.\n\nAfter finishing two large pizzas, it still was not enough. So we ordered a pesto pizza with chicken and garlic. This pizza tasted really good and had tons of chicken on it and maybe just a little too much pesto. The pizzas here are thin crust, and it's a lot easier to fold each slice to eat it. I really liked that there was a bit of a crunch to the crust.\n\nSo our waitress was a little too anxious to clear our plates. I think this might be because they were so busy and probably wanted to try to clear the tables quicker so they could seat the people waiting for a table. She did check up on us often to make sure we had enough food and that everything was ok. \n\nNow here is where the 5 stars comes in. One of the guys in our group couldn't finish his slice of pizza, so he asked her to box it up for him. As we were about to leave, he asked her if she had the pizza. When she went back to the kitchen to get it, apparently someone had thrown it out instead of boxing it up for our friend. She informed the manager about what happened and the manager offered to either make a personal size pizza for our friend, or give us a complimentary slice of cheesecake.\n\nOf course we took the cheesecake and got the plain cheesecake with raspberry sauce and it was heavenly!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Me being me, i was scared to vier away and try something new and give up what is always sure to be a wonderful pizza experience! \n\nSo how did i try Grimaldi's?? Well, i was in a wedding on Friday and was busy all day from 9am-till after the reception ending at about 11:00pm, leaving the husband to fend for himself for the day!\n\nI get a call about 4:00pm, \"honey, I have a surprise for you! Can i tell you what it is? Can i please???\" My reply \"No love, that would make it not be a surprise anymore, now i have something to look forward to...  I will get it when i see you!\" and due to the fact that i at this point have large hair, too much make-up on and am in a freezing cold reception room trying to get all the name cards placed on the tables and get the bride ready and keep her happy, while keeping the kids outta the way and clean in their flower girl dresses i am excited to have a surprise waiting for me when all is said and done!!!\n\nDriving home after a beautiful wedding, the husband says... \"are you excited for your surprise? Can i give you a hint??\"\n\n\"Yes dear, i am VERY excited for my surprise, lay it on me!\" \n\n\"Remember what we wanted to try, but didnt want to give something else up for?\"\n\nI came home to half a pizza from Grimaldi's!!!!!!! :)\n\nAAAaaahhhh, how cute!!\n\nOk, back to the review.. while it was cold and not pipping hot and fresh i few minutes of heating up, it was wonderful!!! Now, I cant wait to go get one and try it fresh, its WAY closer to the house than Settebello's is and now I am willing to give it a try and vier away at least once!\n\nSo for now 4 stars, and if this location is closer or better for you than Settebello's is (at least for now till they move next to Whole Food's in The District) it is a fair trade off, or even if you want to go crazy and mix it up a bit!!!\n\nNow can i get a.... WWHHOOOAAAA PIZZA!!!!!!! :)","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":2}

I'll remove them from the equation for this review.\n\nSo I've had NY pizza before...huge honking slices where folding is not just what the cool kids do, it's necessary to not give yourself a Chelsea grin while eating.  These slices are a bit more manageable in size...and much better tasting, in my opinion.\n\nI looked forward to the white pizza we got, but I discovered they really load the ricotta on if that's what you order...and too much ricotta just doesn't sit well with me.  It tasted good, but it felt like my mouth was being stuffed with foam.\n\nThe mushroom, pepperoni, and sun-dried tomato pizza...now this was par excellence.  Even ignoring that sun-dried tomatoes may be my #1 condiment of all time (even beating out giardiniera), the crust was good, and the light sauce let the toppings shine.\n\nBesides the food, we barely waited despite having a big party, and the service was good enough.

I love how you can customize your own pizza exactly how you want it and the ingredients are always high quality.

The salads are huge, and fresh so keep that in mind when ordering, as the small house salad can easy feed two.

He goes for lunch a couple times a month and I've always said \"I'll try it sometime.\"  Part of the problem was that it's right by my favorite Mexican fast food place, Cafe Rio.  Well, tonight we finally tried the famous Grimaldi's and I'll tell you what, this is a \"I'll go on a diet tomorrow\" kind of restaurant.  \n\nWe were the leading edge of the dinner crowd so no problem getting preferred seating indoors.  Quick attention by Anthony, our capable, informative and entertaining server.  When we declared our \"first time visitor\" status, he patiently explained the three different styles of pizza, the salads, and \"Oh, yes, we have calzone too!\" \n\nWe settled on a split medium, 1\/2 ham\/pepperoni and 1\/2 pesto & jalapeno & basil (can you tell which one is the meat eater?).  Anthony wisely paired our selection with a Pinot Noir from Italy that matched perfectly.  So much so, we trusted him and got the bottle to finish at the castle (home).\n\nPizza is like sex, it's never bad unless you don't give it a chance.  And in this case, this was one of THE BEST PIZZA's I've ever had.  Timely, crisp, tasty, aromatic (and perfectly matching wine) and absolutely hit the spot.  I declared early that I would save room for Bailey's oreo cookie crust cheese cake.  I almost faltered and finished my 1\/2 of the pizza which would have left me too stuffed.\n\nBut, I exhibited massive amounts of discipline and saved one slice for later consumpiton and ordered the heralded cheesecake (with two forks 'cuz I'm that kind of date).  Oh My GOSH!!!  This stuff should be on the front page of the Review Journal.  Seriously!  I'm not a big fan of sweets, but I can appreciate a near perfect taste when given the chance.  Presentation = 10, texture = 10, taste = 10 and memory = 10.  Well done, Grimaldi's!!\n\nBefore we left, we had the chance to give our thanks and kudos to Gino for having such an awesome place.  So maybe it took three years to finally try this place, it won't take very long before our next visit.  Well done everyone!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My wife started with a carafe of wine called Drops Of Jupiter.. She loved it (ended up getting some at Total Wine after dinner) and I had the house Bloody Mary, which uses pizza sauce instead of tomato juice, and garnished with pepperoni, cherry tomato, basil, and olives, VERY good. We started with Antipasto which was excellent!  For our pizza order, she had the gluten free Margherita, and I had the Margherita minus the basil, add kalamata olives. Now, mind you.. we are becoming pizza snobs, and are now on a mission to try the best of the best in Las Vegas. It will take a LOT to knock this pizza out of the top place, in my books. Not only was the pizza out of this world, the ambience, even being on a busy Friday night was just what we were hoping for. The service we received from Chelsea was impeccable!!!!  She was beyond helpful, and just a real sweetheart!  We will be asking for her every time we go back, without hesitation. I truly cannot think of anything bad to say about this place. To those of you who are saying this pizza wasn't good, it was too thin, it was too this, too that....  I'm telling you right now, Dominos, and Papa Johns..... IS NOT REAL PIZZA!!!!!  Say that over, and over in your head until you start to understand it. \n\nWe finished the evening with dessert, which is something that we NEVER do, and boy am I glad we did!  We shared a piece of butterscotch toffee cheesecake, and it did not disappoint one bit!  Paired that with a cup of amazing cappuccino, and I was one happy, happy man. Now, the food is not terribly cheap, but I have zero problem paying good money for good food, and even better service, and that's just what we got. I've paid more for worse food, and worse service. \n\nIf you happen to read this Chelsea, please know that we thoroughly  enjoyed our night, thanks to you and Grimaldi's. And we will take your advice and come back on a weeknight when it's less busy!  And the little tip about the certain time of day to get the best tasting pizza, we'll keep that to ourselves :-) Thank you again, and we'll see you real soon!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Aaahhh, those were the days. \n\nA few nights ago, my family and I thought we would try to renew that spark with Grimaldi's. Instead, we were treated with unevenly cooked pizza (kind of doughy, yet burnt in some spots) and so-so service. Every topping other than cheese is additional $2.00, so the bill adds up quick. Add in the $2.50 per soft drink, and I was starting to feel like the meal just wasn't worth it. \n\nThe caprese salad as an appetizer was a great start to our meal-although it could have used a little salt.

There were a lot of wait staff, but only two 20 something customers.  The menu is pretty much pizza and salads.  My husband was the one craving pizza, so I let him order a sausage, mushroom, and onion regular 16\" pie.  The pizza is New York style; thin, chewy crust.  There was a nicely spicy sausage, a real stringy cheese and fresh mushrooms and onions.  Then why didn't I like it?  It's the crust, Mr. Pizza Man!  Yes, they were spinning and twirling it.  Yes, it had pockets of char.  But overall it had NO flavor.  The pizza at Settebello is so much better there is no contest.  \n\nThe service started strong with quick drinks and refills, but ended on a bad note.  We not only got the wrong bill (nope, we did not have salad and Tirimisu.  The only other customers in the house did.), but to add insult to injury we practically had to stand on our chairs and shout to get it fixed because all the staff was flirting with the 20 somethings.\n\nWould we come back?  Nope.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

For years, I've always thought that pizza was just pizza! Little did I know, pizza here is beyond Little Caesar's!\n\nI am a part of a charity, and we actually held a charity event here a few months ago, and it was the first time I've ever stepped foot into this place. I mean, I've seen it around, but never got to trying it.  Let me tell you! The entire staff including the manager were all wonderful, accommodating, and super friendly!  They had plenty of recommendations (Everthing was basically recommended, and I'm going to have to agree!)\n\nNote: It is all thin-crust goodness! From the classic sauce, to the white sauce, all the way to the pesto sauce-- all G double O D = GOOD! There is also a list of toppings you may choose from (tomatoes, mushroom, SUN DRIED TOMATOES, anchovies, and the list goes on), and also different sizes of pizza. I'd recommend the biggest one (you know, so you can save the rest for later. You gotta strategize!!). So about the pizza, I'll leave it at that. Now it's your turn to try it!\n\nNow onto the desserts! I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I'll definitely eat a slice here! There is a variety to choose from as well (RECURRING THEME: so many to choose from, all so GOOD)! I have personally tried the oreo cheesecake (I highly recommend), original NY style, and the pumpkin cheesecake... which were all just perfection melting in my mouth! Yes, melt it does. The consistency of the cheesecake is just so perfect, probably why I'll only like cheesecake here at Grimaldi's!! Aside from the cheesecake, you must try the cannoli!!! JUST DO IT!\n\nFUN FACT: Grimaldi's has a unique water system, where their water comes directly from NY, to get that authentic NY style pizza. DID I GET YOU NOW??...\n\nI HOPE SO... GO NOW!

Bring on the Grimaldis Margarita pizza!  They nailed it!  The slightly sweet Marinara sauce, thin sliced fresh mozzarella rounds and fresh basil leaves are the trio of flavors that define this pie.  \n\nFor those hailing from the Big Apple folding a slice is the only way you can walk and eat in the subway or as you rush to your next destination. When folded the end should not sag and drop its toppings if you're consuming a \"plain pie\".  It's survival 101.  Try it on your slice at Grimaldis...it passed the test.\n\nMy recent trip to Vegas was the second time I've been to this establishment.  It was on my punch-list since my last trip 2 years earlier.  My BW another couple and I shared a large freshly prepared house salad (easily enough for 4-6 hungry eaters), some draft brews and the large Margarita pie made up our dinner out.  Service was efficient and fast (perhaps too fast since we were still passing the salad bowl around when the pie came).  The dining space was a little noisier than I like but, when the pizza arrived, no one needed to talk.  The pizza disappeared rapidly and I easily could have taken down another slice without much encouragement.  A TOTALLY enjoyable dinner for 4 under $50 is hard to come by in Vegas. \n\nOh yes, before we left Sin City a week later we went back for a 2nd time.

I live in NJ and know about good pizza.  To have a Grimaldi's on the West Coast is a blessing.  My parents could never find good pizza out there.

Take \"Brooklyn\" off your box! Brooklyn pizza is good, this was a pizza fail!! Over an hour wait for burnt pizza? My full review will soon to follow!!!\n----That was just the tip^^---\n\nI was going to wait to review this place, but I can't. I'm so infuriated I could scream. We walked into Grimaldi's (Mind you, this was my very first time here) and while we were approaching the hostess, I saw her roll her eyes at my kids. LISTEN-- If you can't handle the service industry... BEAT IT! I worked every role in the restaurant business for years, including upper management. That's not how your greet guests. (Especially ones that Yelp!!)\nThe night was NOT starting off well at all. \n\nShe asks us \"how many?\" and said that there was a 25 minute wait. That was fine for us. We told her that we didn't mind eating outside if that helped. She QUICKLY replies \"There's NO room to sit outside\".... Really? I see two open tables and a large table of 6-8 people with to-go boxes on their laps. She obviously didn't want to take another table. \n\nNow I'm irritated. I hate liars. I hate mean people, and I hate LAZY employees!  \n\nWe got sat about 10 minutes later. Our waiter, \"AJ\" was nice, he took our app and drink orders. Not to my surprise he screws that up. We ordered red sangria, he brought white. It wasn't a big deal, but I was already annoyed from all the prior attitude. We really should have left, but the kids were hungry and it's a school night.\n\nWe quickly order two pizzas and crossed our fingers that our night was about to get better. \n\n... Little did we know that it would get worse...\n\nAJ, our waiter, came back a few minutes later with a red sangria in hand, apologizing for the confusion. (Ok, good work there)\n\n\nAfter that we sat there for another hour, watching all of the tables (that arrived after us) get served their pizza! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? An hour for pizza? The waiter kept saying  that it was coming. Our kids were hungry, getting antsy and I was really annoyed. \n\nThe manager came over and said our pizza was just about up. My husband told him what happened and how we have been sitting for an hour. What did the manager reply? He said we've only been there for 25 minutes!!! HOW DARE YOU?? I said \"Really? here's my Yelp and FB check-ins showing the timestamps\"...... He knew he was caught out there and said our pizzs was next and he'd try to help work out the bill. ----GEE Thanks. You basically call my husband and I liars, make your business look horrible, then just \"try' to make up for it? I told my husband I wanted to leave. We only stayed because we were curious what was going to happen next. \n\nAnother 5-7 minutes go by, and our pizza arrives. Just ONE of them lol. I explained to the waiter that I am a Brooklyn born Italian and NO freaking pizza is worth an hour wait. He didn't really have much of a reaction.\n\nOur second Pizza came another 2 minutes later. I take a bite... and to complete the WORST pizza story EVER.... IT WAS BURNT! Not crispy, not well done, outright pitch black burnt. It tasted like charcoal. We told the waiter we were done and over it and wanted to leave. \n\nHe brings over the bill, the manager took $33.50 off of the $95.00 bill. \n\nWe paid and left.\n\nNEVER EVER AGAIN! First and last time. \n\n(Burnt pizza picture was posted in my profile. YUCK)","useful":15,"funny":2,"cool":2}

This place is the best pizza in the entire world!  At least in my opinion.  We stumbled on this place a couple years ago.  We thought, hey a pizza place to check out.  I cannot tell you how delicious the pizza tastes.  We usually order a Mediterranean salad and a small pizza with meatballs and mushrooms. Yes small because the pies are huge.  This pizza place has several locations over the united states.  They charcoal bake the pies to perfection.  The ingredients are fresh, and I mean fresh! The mozzarella is to die for. We have been to other pizza places and we always seem to compare them to this place.  You get a lot of people that say no way the pizza is better at blah blah city, but we are in Las Vegas not New York!  So what are you waiting for try this place out and if you are disappointed, then either something is seriously wrong with you or you have no pulse. \nI almost forgot, get the cheese cake or the tiramisu they are awesome! \nCheers!","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1}

We went for dinner last night and everything was perfect, the food, weather, ambiance!\n\nWe ordered a small caesar salad to share, yes share, yes a small ($7).  A perfect portion for two.  The dressing was zesty, ample, and quite addicting.  The croutons were fresh, large, and crispy (but not jaw breaking).  The lettuce was fresh and green.  The parmesan was good but the stuff that was factory shredded, not freshly shaved.  I'm a sucker for freshly shaved parm, you know the stuff that resembles potato chips.  Regardless, the bf will be picking up a random caesar salad after work for me to chow down on.\n\nThe pizza was quite delightful!  Their crust is thin and flaky with very good flavor.  Their sauce gets two thumbs up for not being overpowering or chunky, like some of these pizza joints tend to get a little over zealous about.  And the cheese, oh the cheese...it's freshly made mozzarella!  Each pizza gets thin slices of this freshly made mozzarella!  Therefore, when your pizza is presented, it almost glows because the mozzarella is a beautifully brilliant white!  Grimaldi's uses some delicious toppings too, if you so choose to garnish your pie.  Instead of the traditional size pepperonis, they use miniature sized ones.  I think it makes the pepperoni pie easier to eat, but that's just my opinion.\n\nThe ambiance of the Eastern Ave. Grimaldi's is quite charming, even for being in a strip mall.  We here in Las Vegas are lucky to have such beautiful weather pretty much year round, therefore open air bistros like Grimaldi's are a gem on such gorgeous days\/nights.  The layout of the restaurant is well-thought out.  Their bar is two-sided.  One side being for the patio, and the other side for the indoor bistro--kind of ingenious!  Let it be known, the bar does have draught beer on tap (Peroni, Blue Moon, Blue Moon Pumpkin, and a few others).  The wine menu is geared more towards everyday wines (most bottles under $50).  They have an assortment of reds, whites, blushes available by the glass and bottle.   Liquorwise, they are limited to basics, Bombay Sapphire, Three Olives Vodka, 1800, J.W. Black Label, Jack, etc.  So just remember when you order your cocktail, this is NOT an ultra lounge.  So don't be a snob just because they may not carry your favorite liquor, suck it up and try something different!\n\nI had a blast at Grimaldi's, not because of the bottle of Riesling or bottle of Pinot Noir, but because of being surrounded by good food, good ambiance, good service, and great company!","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Quality ingredients do make some tasty pizzas.  I recently discovered Grimaldi's and I think it's about to become one of my go-to dinner destinations.  It's a bit on the pricey side for the pie - it's not the place if you're looking for a cheap date - but when you're in the mood to gab with your friends over wine, beer, salads, and thin crust pizza, check this place out.\n\nThe salads are meant to be shared.  I like the feel of that.  I do love a good salad, but the pizza is what drew me back after my first visit.  The crust is nice and thin, with a slight chewy bite.  It's often a little charred around the edges, which I adore.  The cheese is thinly sliced fresh mozzarella.  It's subtle, with a hint of sweet, and even though mozz generally lacks flavor, there is something about this chewy white melty cheesy goodness that makes me say \"mmm\".  I really like how they smoosh up the Kalamata olives so that the little crushed pieces are splattered all over the pizza.\n\nPlus, they feature some local brews.  I enjoyed my pie with a Tenaya nut brown tonight.  Yay for supporting locals!  I think the biggest drawback is the lack of price breaks for topping combos.  Four toppings can cost you the price of the base pie, yowzahs.  At this Eastern Ave location there is some lovely outdoor seating (although I can think of better ambiance than Eastern Ave, but you can only ask for so much here in Hendertucky), and I find the indoor ambiance rather pleasant.  I've experienced nothing but friendly service.

I love the pizza and salads and wine selection. Food was great tonight! The hostess was amazing! She remembered my name up until the moment we walked out (impressive). Typically, service is decent. However, after tonight, I feel compelled to write this review. Our waitress was Stephanie. She started out good, chatted with us about opening the bottle of wine, then when she was done, I asked her to bring us some silverware. She never did remember to bring the silverware. I had to get up and go to the hostess stand, after the salad arrived, to get my own. Then when the pizza came, she took my dirty plate but took a while to come back with the new plate. After finishing my first piece without a plate, we had to flag her down to get the plate (she forgot that too). At one point, she asked, \"did they ever offer you oregano or garlic\"? We were thinking, 'who are THEY, isn't she our server'? When we answered, \"no,\" she never did ask if we'd like some, then turned and walked away. She also never refilled the water.\n\nWe completed a comment card and took it to the hostess stand and asked that it be delivered to the manager. We saw our waitress run over to read it, along with the rest of the girls at the hostess stand.\n\nWill I go back again: Yes! I do love the food. I'm hoping; however, that service gets better.

I was \"pizza chained\" into submission. \n\nI came in, bellied up to the bar, and ordered a Goose Island and Caesar salad.

Grimaldi's on Eastern has always delivered a solid pie that reminds us of back home. See people complaining about the crust and I think they are simply uneducated.

The house sauce is flavorful, not overwhelming.  For a treat, I always order the pesto sauce, which tastes of fresh basil every time.  Their meaty toppings (sausage, pepperoni, etc.) are very good so if you are a traditional pizza eater, I suggest the sausage with roasted sweet peppers.  The only drawback is: toppings are $2-$4 each so the price can stack up quickly for a regular-ingredients pie.\n\nHowever, if you're in the mood for a different palette, order the pesto sauce with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, and grilled chicken.  I find that this combination puts together an absolutely delicious gourmet pizza seldom found elsewhere.  Fresh basil pesto, slightly sweet & lavish ricotta, top-quality sun-dried tomatoes, and tender grilled chicken always win me over at first bite.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Their ingredients are for the most part better than their chain counter parts. The pizzas aren't greasy or heavy, in fact, they only seem to have thin crust pizzas (no deep dish for chi-town peeps).

As far as that goes...hands down the best pizza on earth. I have traveled extensively thru Italy and Spain and as a kid my parents owned a pizza joint. I feel like I have a pretty good palate for picking a winner.\nWhich brings us to Grimaldi's Las Vegas. I have visited this location a handful of times and only today realized that I really like this place. As other reviewers mentioned, it's not particularly cheap. You can't get great pizza for Pizza Hut prices. Today I also realized that the service there is really good. I also appreciate they carry Lavazza coffee and when they refill your cup they bring you a whole new fresh cup from the kitchen instead of just \"topping you off\". \nThe people seem genuinely friendly and the place is very clean and open. I see a lot of families there having a nice meal which is great to see these days. \nNext time you want a good pie with quality ingredients, give them a whirl. Plus let's face it $25 for a large pizza isn't the most expensive meal you're ever going to have!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Avoid excessive toppings which can overwhelm the wonderful crust, keep it simple. Highly recommended.\n\nOne update.

I've read and heard so many good things. \n\nFood quality - 1 star\nInside of my pizza box lay a black ring of burnt crust with a smattering of toppings tossed on top. The crust was burnt so much we could not eat it. I know a brick oven crust has some character and some char to the edges, but this was ridiculous. We paid $2 each for four different toppings. For $2 of onions, I counted 13 pieces of onions. $2 for a small handful of jalapeño STEMS. The mushrooms seemed like they came from a can. The sausage was the only tasty topping on our pizza. The cheese was as flavorless as the crust. Maybe if the cheese was burnt, it would have had some flavor. \n\nFood price - 1 star\nCompared to similar pizza places, excluding the fast food pizza places like Pizza Hut, the prices are a little high. If you only want a couple of toppings, your pizza will be cheap. If you like a lot of toppings, you should bring you last paycheck. My four topping, large pizza, complete with flavorless cheese and a burnt crust came two $25. \n\nOverall, not a great experience.

Everywhere my friend Leo and I go we look up the best pizza places in the area.  I just moved to Las Vegas and asked where we should go to get some good pizza  He said he has heard of a place called Grimaldi's and that it has some very good reviews so we decided to go.\n\nWe go there around lunchtime and was greeted by a very pleasant staff. Since it was our first time there the manager of the place came out to greet us and recommended a few items on the menu.  We started off with a  Chicken Caesar  Salad which was amazing.  I don't like my Caesar to be too fishy, this one was perfect.  It was a nice fresh start to our meal.  Then we ordered a small calzone with meatballs and pepperoni which by the way is far from small.  It came with this marinara sauce that was so delightful that I wanted to take some home with me so I could dip everything in it.  It was cooked to perfection as was the pizza we ordered.  The pizza was a large with red sauce, pepperoni, sausage and basil.  Let me tell you, after eating there I can easily say Las Vegas' best pizza by a long shot.  The pizza was hand tossed with the freshest ingredients, topped perfectly and was also cooked to perfection.  I don't always judge a pizza by whats on it but by the way the dough is cooked as well.  I usually don't eat the crust but I couldn't help myself here, it was just so good.\n\nSo after all that food I had to try the desert.  I figured since everything else was so good the deserts must be the bomb, and they were.  I had the tiramisu and he had the canoli.  I didn't think I had anymore room left but when I tasted that tiramisu I couldn't stop until it was gone.  \n\nBetween the awesome staff, the great food and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant, I have to say it is the best pizza place I have ever been so far.  If another place wants to take the top spot in my book they are going to have to be something spectacular because this is an amazing place to eat.

They are truly the bomb!\n\nMy last adventure here was last night, but not as a customer in the traditional sense.

Found out pretty quickly Grimaldi's isn't the best pizza place for young kids or parents with young kids. The place is kind of intimate (i.e., small). So when you sit, the back of your chair slams up against your neighbor's. So, because we had little kids, we spent the entire time sitting down, getting up, banging neighbors, apologizing - repeat till fed up.\n\nAsked for a kid menu - \"no.\" Asked if they had mac and cheese, or spaghetti with tomato sauce, or buttered pasta - \"no, only pizza.\" Asked if they had a vegetarian pizza, or a \"Hawaiian\" pizza, or a BBQ chicken pizza - \"uhhh, yeah, we don't have that.\" WTH?\n\nThe left side of their menu is pizza. The right side of their menu is salad. There is no other side. And they don't have combinations. They have ingredients and you pick what you want. And as each ingredient is around $3 bucks, if you want a \"vegetarian\", tack on  an extra $30!!! So, $46 for a large vegetarian pizza. Again, WTH?\n\nWe ordered a pizza with red sauce and extra cheese for the kids, and a pizza with red sauce, tomatoes and basil, and a pizza with white sauce, fresh garlic, and mushroom for the adults. The red sauce pizzas were kind of bleh - very little sauce and only spots of cheese. Literally. Spots. Of. Cheese. If you're looking for a pizza covered, smothered, and dripping with yummy melting cheese (and we ordered extra cheese, remember?), what we received was not it. Not even close. Picture this: a pizza with a small to medium amount of pepperoni. Now replace the pepperoni with cheese. That's the Grimaldi's \"extra cheese\" pizza! haha\n\nThe white sauce pizza, with mushrooms, on the other hand, was a different story. The white sauce itself was like an excellent alfredo sauce, with butter, and parmesan, and tons of garlic. And, unlike the red sauce, they actually put a decent amount of it on the pizza. The white sauce pizza was that pizza where you can't wait for one of your friends to try it just so they can tell you, \"yes, you're right, that's fricken' amazing.\" It was one of the best pizzas I'd ever tasted.\n\nIf we lived closer, my wife and I would go to Grimaldi's and, with a white sauce pizza with a couple beers, we'd be in heaven. Going in there with a party of 13, four of them little ones, and with it being a not-so-kid-friendly establishment, this was more like hell.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It falls into the \"night out\" category for me instead of the \"pizza to go\" category. The ambiance inside is nice and the service is pretty good, so you feel ok sitting in there and hanging out for a while with a couple beers and a pie, unlike, say, Giovanni's up the road. \nMain point: I really like the pizza. Nice thin crust, so you don't feel like you're taking in 3000 calories (I'm not saying you're not....you may be...it just doesn't feel like it). The cheese is (I think) mozzarella, so it has a really good flavor that is different from your typical take out place. All the toppings are really good and seem pretty high quality.\nThe side salads are also really good. \nOne star off for the high prices and (like others have noted) the fact that you can't order a specialty pizza. Instead, you have to get a large ($18 for cheese I think) and then add on your toppings at $2-4 each. If you get 4 or 5 toppings, you're looking at like $30+ for a pizza. But hey, that's another reason why I say this is a \"night out\" place and not a \"pizza to go\" place.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've gained a little experience since then, but maybe this place has worsened a little too.\n\nA year after my first visit, I returned to Grimaldi's for another birthday pizza. I ordered the same large pizza (red sauce) with meatballs. From the birthday coupon, I got $19 credit back for it again. I think prices have gone up though, with $16 for the base 18\" large pizza and $4 for the meatballs. I ended up having $1 worth of pizza to pay.\n\nLet's cut to the chase. Despite being quite hungry (I'd arrived straight from work), I wasn't very impressed with what I tasted this time around. The pizza just seemed pretty bland. Maybe some of the acidic tomato notes stood out, but not the sliced meatballs, and definitely not the cheese. I tried all sorts of condiments on top, including parmesan, red pepper flakes, and pepper, but I just wasn't getting much help. The table didn't even have oregano (or garlic, as I now recall) as it did last year, but I don't know how much those would have helped even if they'd been available.\n\nI should note that I ate some of the leftover pizza after taking it home and popping it in the oven, and that pizza stood out in terms of crispy crust and just having more of the flavors. Actually, it tasted hot, as opposed to the warm-ish pizza that our server was able to touch despite warning us of the temperature. I'm guessing that there was a delay at the restaurant from oven to table due to the hectic service during the already crowded dinner hours, and that lessened the experience.\n\nI would have considered keeping my rating at four stars for the pizza, but I also tried a dessert trio ($10) with half-sized portions of the tiramisu, Oreo cheesecake, and seasonal pumpkin cheesecake. Perhaps the latter was the most flavorful of the bunch, but again, they all seemed a little too bland and fleeting in flavor. The number of superior versions of all of these desserts outweigh the misses, so I can only conclude that the desserts are below average. I'd rather have the tiramisu at Trattoria Nakamura-ya again, the pumpkin cheesecake from Lazy Dog, or pretty much any slice from Cheesecake Factory (a place that's not even top of the line, mind you).\n\nI'll be back in a year, but I won't be too enthused. Furthermore, I'm not even going to consider returning until then. On top of having had good experiences at Flour & Barley (via a Yelp event) and Little Tony's, I know that I can customize a far more complex and delicious pizza at Blaze Pizza not too far down the street. I simply can't see the same luster in Grimaldi's as I did before.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":4}

And this is a different location than the first one I tried. This one I noticed to be much snaller. But I knew the pizza to be great thun crust style and thought it would be good for my family to try.\n\nThere were 7 of us last night. We got to the restaurant at what seemed like a late hour to me. Apparently 7:00 PM isn't really that late and the restaurant was packed. It only aboutb5 minutes before we got a seat though. They were quick on that. Unfortunately we were put into a small side room crammed around two small tables. Lucky for us we are a close family and didn't mind the close quarters. Ut got a little stuffy in there onve we all had a few drinks in us and hot pizzas in front of us.\n\nSpeaking of pizza and drinks, the food was the easy part. A Grimaldi house salad, a Mediterranean salad, a large The Don Pizza (pepperoni, sausage and meatballs) and a large with sausage and mushrooms. The drinks were a little more challenging. What beers do we want? Which wine do we want? Too many options you know.\n\nThe salads were fine. A nice variety of ingredients and a nice vinaigrette. We could have used a bit more of the dressing and my aunt actually did order some more on the side. Salad is just filler any how. It was the pizza we were there for. \n\nHalf of us ate the one with mushrooms and sausage and we all shared the Don. Both were really good but I think we all preferred the Don. The meatballs on it were great. A good size with a fresh flavor. Both pizzas were a little soggy in the middle. Being such a thin crust it cannot hold up to the sauce too well. The edges, however, were superb. Crispy and slighlty charred. Most all of us ate the crust and there were a few in the group who don't normally do so. What does that tell you?\n\nIn the end, everyone was pleased with the choice which made me happy because this family has a tendency to be hypercritical of restaurants. We all enjoyed ourselves, pigged out on some quality pie and teased the waiter a bit. He was cool with it. He was even laughing when trying to take the order of the group next to us. His quality customer service was noteable as was the service of the lady who brought our food. She cleared the table for the salad bowls and served up a couple slices of pizza to get us started.

We called ahead to let them know we had a party of 13 coming and they informed us that they don't take reservations, but if we get there before 5:30pm we should be fine. Okay. We head down and arrive at 5:30. As one of our party enters one of the hosts says, \"Oh you must be the party of 13.\" Yup, we have 13 and called ahead, but were told you don't hold tables. ANOTHER party of 13 enters right after us. They claim that they called ahead and were told a table would be prepared for them. The host staff then proceeded to seat the other party ahead of us! Really!?! We stood in front of the cold, crowded entrance for over a half hour waiting for our table. \n\nI really don't feel this way often, but we were all disgusted with how we were treated. I talked to the manager afterward who seemed to me to be pretty disingenuous. Like, \"Yea, yea, that's terrible, we're so sorry. Wow, we feel so bad, is that all? Oh we'll discount your bill.\" She ended up taking $10 bucks off, which wasn't what we were looking for; but ended up being a slap in the face. \n\nThis review is intended to reflect this particular location.

In fact- it seems to be the only reviews I ever post. But I felt I had to share my experience. \n\nI had heard so many great things about Grimaldis, and I had been craving coal fired pizza for a while. We were anticipating this pie for quite some time, as we planned out a pizza night with our good friends a week prior to finally ordering. \n\nI would like to disclose we did do take out. So that could very well be why our pie was unsatisfactory. \nWe ordered two large pizzas. One pepperoni and one veggie pizza. Our total was $50. This seemed on the higher side for two large pies, but we were okay with the price due to what we were anticipating. We picked up our two pizzas right on the estimated time, and brought it directly home. I live about five minutes away. We immediately served the pizza to our hungry pizza loving group to find that our pies were rather soggy. The outside of the crust (where you would hold the pizza) had a nice solid texture and char, but the rest of piece was Almost raw as you moved towards the middle of the slice. The dough underneath felt wet- If that makes sense? I couldn't even pick mine up because it had no form. In my past experiences with coal fired pizzas- I've never had one that was soggy. I was really sad because i was hoping for that crispy charred yet chewy crust. We kept in mind that this could have been because it was boxed to go- but I can't help but compare it to other pizzas I've ordered to go and did not have this same issue.  Also- our pies did not sit for long. \n\nThe pizzas were beautiful, and the size was nice. \nIt could have had an off night, but I don't think we will be ordering out from this spot again. Sad we had such mediocre pizzas.  Hope you all have better experiences!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If the sauce wasn't so bland then I would have given it a 5 (despite the service) ordering for pick up works out great though.

I started as a bartender there.  So Grimaldi's, to me, is more than just another pizza joint.  \n\nGrimaldi's is what true Italian cuisine is all about.  Stated simply, ingredients.  Use ingredients that are the best and in season in your region and you will have wonderful results.  Unfortunately, we are in the middle of the desert where nothing fun to eat grows.  Luckily, everyone ships to Vegas.\n\n  When something is so simple as dough, cheese and sauce, the ingredients have to be the best.  Grimaldi's has a supplier from Italy that imports their tomatoes for them; they even use bottled water to make their dough.  I would think that pizza made from Vegas water would have to be subpar.  We have the worst water I've tasted in the states.  Their toppings, ranging from the pepperoni to the Ricotta cheeses, are all superior to any I've tasted in town.   \n\nThe artist who sculpts the pie also makes a huge difference.  The dough is hand tossed.  I loved watching the head pizza maker, at the time, dance the dough on his finger tips.  His pies were, by far, superior to pies made from some of the other pie makers.  The artist turns the pie while it's in the oven, moving it closer or further from the coals.  This helps to ensure a tasty crust.  There have been a few times when I've eaten there and the pie was delicious with a flaky crusty crust.  There have been other times when the pie was undercooked for my liking and not as crispy.  But, overall, an excellent pie with gourmet ingredients.\n\nSo Grimaldi's, to me, is a place of nostalgia and of mixed feelings of a different time in my life.  The little pizzeria, to me, is quintessential East Coast and Italy.  The former is where I grew up; the latter I dream of going.  I still love Grimaldi's to this day.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":2}

I came here with my husband, three children, two sisters, a niece, a nephew, and two brothers-in-law. I thought the food was pretty good, except for the fact that there was clearly a cheese shortage. Ordering extra cheese wasn't enough. I suppose you would have to order extra, extra, extra cheese if you wanted to actually taste the cheese on your pizza. Oh well, the flavor was good. The white pizza with garlic and mushrooms was excellent. Wow, I would definitely order that again. \n\nHere's the problem with the place - it was REALLY uncomfortable. First of all, when we arrived they made us stand at the front with a bunch of young children until every single person in our party arrived. That policy is extremely irritating for people with young children or elderly in the group. There really wasn't a good place to sit and wait, but we did our best crammed in by the front door. Once everyone arrived, they brought us to our table. That's when things got worse. \n\nThe table was REALLY bad. We were so crammed in that we could barely move. I dreaded each time that a child had to go to the bathroom, or that I had to stand up to do something. I must have banged into the people behind me ten times. I know that table hated me, but come on, I wear a size 4 -- I should be able to stand up to do something briefly and sit down without shoving my behind in anyone's face. That's not asking for too much room. To my dismay, most of the time I banged the chairs at adjacent tables, and found myself apologizing over and over throughout dinner. I was tempted to stand up and just move our entire table, but thought that would make a scene, so I didn't. \n\nThe food was pretty good. The atmosphere was terrible. I might come here again with just one friend, but I would be careful when agreeing to sit at a particular dining table. Decent food, but an uncomfortable dining experience.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Me and my friend have never been here before and we have heard good things about Grimaldi's, so, we decided to give it a try. We ordered the large pesto pizza with itallian sausage on one half of the pie. My friend had a water to drink and I tried the passion fruit iced tea. \n  Now the atmosphere is nice with the lighting a little on the darker side for a nice reaxing feel to it. Now I wasn't to keen on the drink I ordered so I just asked if I could switch it out with a Pepsi or Coke instead. That wasnt a problem. But while my friend and I were waiting for our pizza we were talking and trying to conversate. Unfortunately we were sat right next to the kitchen where they were making all the food, and as my friend was talking, I could barely hear her or make out was she was saying because of the banging noises and cooking that was going on right next to us. I'm sure any other table would have been fine, but because we were sitting adjacent to where the noise is, I was just annoyed a little bit about that. \n  When we did get our pizza though, it was definitely delectably delicious (LOL try saying that three times fast). It was a nice NY style thin crust pizza that me and my friend enjoyed very much. Is it the best pizza ever? Naw, not to me. The secret pizza place in the Cosmo is a better NY style pizza joint in vegas to me. But, I did enjoy Grimaldi's Pizza and I will definitely come back again. I had the Pesto so I'll try the White with garlic next time i come here. \n  The only other real minor complaint I had was that I never got a refill on my beverage. I left my glass at the end of the table so they could see that it was empty, and our waitress never noticed it until we were already done eating. And by that time, I didnt even want a refill anymore because that would be a waste of soda. I guess that's my biggest pet peeve when it comes to restaurants.

Half the pizza was pepperoni with jalepenos, the other half with sliced meatballs, ricotta and mushrooms. It arrived nice and hot. I loved the thin crust, it was perfectly foldable.

(see review)  Since I cannot afford to fly to NY at a whim, Vegas is a little closer to home. Although, Grimaldi's isn't exactly in Vegas but it is worth the drive when visiting.\n\nThe biggest advantage to visiting the Vegas location versus Brooklyn is space.  This restaurant is much larger and therefore, no wait time.  The downside is slow service once seated.  You also do not have that 'authentic' down-home feel like the Grimaldi's in BK.  The ambiance is like any other pizza joint, nothing special and nothing unique.\n\nThere's nothing like the original but the white pie here was still pretty damn good.  Don't forget to add sun-dried tomatoes.  And if you have room left, try the cannoli. \n\nSome people like fast food for the 'cheap' deals so if you prefer to stick to the dollar menus or have Domino's just to save a few bucks then keep it moving.  Grimaldi's isn't your cheap or even average-priced pizza.  It is worth the extra $ so treat yourself sometime!\n\n4 STARS for this location\n5 STARS for the original location - must try but beware of the long line!","useful":14,"funny":4,"cool":13}

My cousin thought it could be crisper but just ask your waiter to cook it a little longer for that extra crunch or if you have to many toppings can make it soggy. Maybe the coal oven need to be seasoned more. The decor seems to be standard New York with black and white pictures of famous locals like the Brooklyn bridge Empire State bldg. etc...

Second time, not so much. Of note, our favorite item both times being the negitoro hand roll. This time we ordered one omakase ($80) and one nigiri tasting ($48). The main differences between the omakase and nigiri tasting are 6 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of grilled fish, and miso soup. Was it worth the extra $32? Certainly not. The main problem during this visit was that the serving sizes were significantly smaller than last time, ranging from 1\/3 to 1\/2 smaller. The first time we had 2 nigiri tastings because that was all they were offering at the time. While we weren't stuffed, our hunger was comfortably satiated. This time around we paid for more food, but both left hungry. In fact, as we left, I seriously considered stopping by Ramen Sora! The quality overall is still excellent, except for the surprisingly subpar miso soup, but they have gotten stingy with their portion sizes. Previously, while not an inexpensive night out, the price could be considered reasonable. Sadly this is no longer the case. We are not big eaters and when we pay $128, before tax\/tip, for two tasting menus, we expect to at least not be still hungry at the end. We don't mind shelling out top dollar for great food, but it is difficult to justify paying these prices for what have become miniscule portions of food. In addition, the service this time was inconsistent at best. The timing between courses was highly variable as was when our glasses of water were refilled.

The sushi chefs and servers are so accommodating and truly make your experience one-of-a-kind. I have been here twice and cannot wait to go back. Since it is not on the strip, it may not typically be a restaurant visitors may first consider -- but let me tell you, it is a gem. I have been to a fair share of fantastic sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, and I can tell you Kabuto is my favorite.

The next day I got the call and was able to be seated along the sushi bar with my girlfriend at around 7pm. The restaurant is tiny and easy to miss as it's in a strip mall that seems rundown but is actually the scene of a food renaissance housing many amazing eateries (Raku, Monta, Hwaro, and of course Kabuto). \n\nWe decided to go with the $50 omakase to get a feel of the menu and to taste just how fresh the fish is which is supposedly flown in daily from Spain and Japan. This is something mostly done by high end restaurants with many Forbes stars along the strip. It's Vegas everything gets flown in. \n\nOmakase: Appetizer Sake. Amuse. 10 pc Nigiri, Handroll, and Dessert. There's also an option to add more before your meal and right before the handroll. The experience was a delight as after the sake and amuse the Chef assigned to you will ask for permission to being serving you. (The Japanese culture is very evident which results in very polite staff) Every piece is handmade and the Chef throws in a variety of different items that take you on a carefully selected but wild ride. (But don't worry if there's anything you're not comfortable eating you can let them know before hand as there is a dish with fish sperm) The taste of everything is very clean and fresh. Which is how real Japanese sushi should be enjoyed. Nothing is overpowering and the quality and cut of the fish is what makes the boldest statement. My favorite dish was something that I selected afterwards which was I believe a seared fatty tuna. It absolutely melted in my mouth and I felt like I was eating A5 Wagyu beef. The quality bought me back to Tokyo and the various sushi restaurants I've dine in. This is as authentic as it gets and is definitely something that should be tried by sushi enthusiasts. Although the portions are small it's an experience that's raw, intimate, and it forces you to really taste the sushi as opposed to stuffing as much nigiri and rolls you can into your mouth in an Ayce setting which definitely has it's time and place.  \n\nThoughts: For the price of this experience to only start at $50 is an absolute steal. Go anywhere on the strip for the same thing such as at Morimoto or Zuma and you'll find yourself paying double. For something similar if not barely matching up to the standard of excellence at Kabuto. The chef's have honed their craft for years and you can tell in the precision and care they put into making their cuts. It's something that can only be achieved through thousands of hours of practice. The knives they use and care they put into them reflects that as well. These aren't your regular sushi knives as they range from the upwards of thousands of dollars. Our chef seemed cold at first but after finishing up our experience he began to small talk and was a really chill dude. This again shows that they put alot of effort into their craft and although it may seem intimidating at first you get used to it and find yourself enjoying the detail and attention being put into your food. Kabuto is definitely a steal and I'm afraid that it may not be the case for long but hopefully it is as I plan to return for the Yoroi or Kabuto.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If you're looking for izakaya style food or ramen you're looking at the wrong restaurant.  It's pricey, but worth it for amazing fish and beautiful culinary arts from the chefs. \n\nWe've had all the omakase menus and in my opinion, the best is to do the least expensive one and order more nigiri.  Or, just order nigiri a la carte.  The star of this restaurant is the fish so why fill my tummy with other items like miso soup and grilled items that I can get else where that are done way better (insert Raku next door).  Can I just mention how awesome the rice is too?  I've noticed that the chefs bring small batches of rice from the kitchen to the sushi bar - that's probably how they keep it so fluffy and warm and amazing.  Rice to me has always just been rice.  But here at Kabuto - the rice is in it's own league!  One time we walked in and they didn't have seats available at the bar so we had a table - I feel like that one time the rice wasn't as amazing as I normally remember it.  Maybe it's because the servers have to bring it over to us and the timing cools the rice so it just ends of tasting like normal rice?  Definitely make reservations at the bar so the rice stays amazing when you put it in your mouth.  \n\nAnyway, the salmon roe and kamashita toro are must trys in my book.  Oh, and the o toro hand roll.  But make sure to eat it right away so the seaweed stays crisp.  YUM!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Cream cheese! Wow! Do you like that?

Don't be put off by the location. \n\nI've read some other reviews that seem knowledgable quibble about the temperature of the rice and a few other details. Regardless, odds are that even among foodies this will easily be one of the top Japanese\/sushi meals you'll experience. In the United States, certainly. \n\nBecause we're little piggies that love good food, my dinner date and I had an omakase plus a few more pieces a la carte. My dining companion had been before and couldn't stop raving about the place. And he knows good food better than many other people I know. Literally everything we had was sublime. However, here are a few favorites:\n\nMountain grape sake\nFukko- baby Japanese seabass\nKochi-whitefish \nAkami-tuna\nMejina-opal eye\nInada-young yellowtail \nChopped toro\nChutoro\n\nEven the hand roll towards the end was marvelous. The nori it was wrapped in alone tasted incredible.\n\nI also very much liked that service was thorough, efficient and not at all intrusive. Waitstaff was informative but not doing constant check-backs before you've even had a chance to chew your first bite because you're actually trying to enjoy your meal with someone else. \n\nPrices were reasonable considering the superlative quality. Not cheap, but not astronomical either. \n\nSo don't cry yourself to sleep tonight if you can't make it out to Jiro's. Do try to come here if you're in Las Vegas instead.

Stick with $48 Nigiri Course if you are still planning to go there. Paying more doesn't mean getting something better at this restaurant. Having Nigiri course would be the best bet otherwise you will be left hungry.\n\nVariety of the fish you get as Nigiri and sashimi are unique and worth the visit.

Fishy to start, and the back of the house cannot accommodate to your specific request you make. \n\nTiming is off.

Lead chef's and sous chef's attitude towards the youngest one was just horrible. If they think guests wont understand japanese so they can be so negative to fellow chefs... I doubt their common sense. \n\nLanguage barrier---on servers, sushi chefs, and the back of the house. \n\nYou will get better service at this restaurant if you are fluent in japanese otherwise you will be treated in a cookie cutter-ed matter.

Edomae sushi all about the quality of ingredients and preparation, rather than strange combinations. Purely amazing! I recommend starting with the middle omokase (yoroi) and adding extra bites afterwards. It is hard to get reservations and find, but your mind will be blown. Definitely order the tuna triangle and meijina with lemon and sea salt. The chefs are true artists.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

But my experience was cut short due to an allergy, and the way the restaurant handled the bill afterwards deeply affected my feelings about this place. \n\nThe first issue was that we had a reservation for 7. I asked to bump it up to 8 and was told no. I persisted and asked if we moved the rez time later, could it be accomodated. Yes, but then my friend didn't want to dine that late. So we sit down on the 2 tables . . . set for 7, with an empty chair. Why was 8 too much trouble to accomodate?\n\nI had about 7 courses (including the opening cocktail) before I could no longer continue. I apparently had an allergy to something that I was unaware of. The server did ask when we sat down about allergies for the $80 omakase menu and I let her know. She made a suggestion that I stay away from another fish that is similar to the one I was allergic to, but I had never had before, so that was appreciated. I ended up having to leave to get some medication, and told the server that I could no longer continue eating. While I was gone, she apparently told my party that the next 3 courses were already made and she proceeded to put it in the middle of the table for the rest of the diners to share. No other courses came out. I came back and just hung out with my friends until the bill arrived. There was a full charge, which was kind of expected . . . but in every other restaurant I have ever worked in, when there is an allergic reation (whether or not the fault of the restaurant), the person affected never gets charged. After talking with the server, she agreed to take off $10 because she said I only missed 2 courses. She should have done this up front. \n\nSo the food quality was amazing, presentation was very nice. My friends will probably come back and try it again, but for a brand new intimate restaurant, I expected more than just being treated like a number.","useful":4,"funny":4,"cool":0}

I was quite disappointed and I kept talking about to this place to my friends and they were disappointed as well.  First, the service wasn't good.  At one point we were arguing with the server because they lead us to believe something else.  And apparently if you are on two separate tables and are together if you order 2 pieces they just put it on one plate (even other sushi restaurants don't do that) and you pass it over even when you clearly stated a few times that two people want the same fish and so it's 2 orders. \n\nSecondly, the fish shrunk. It seemed like everything was cut in half.  \nThe quality of fish was still great but I can't compare them to the first time I went there because not all the fish were the same.  However, I believe the salmon roe and eel's quality were the same both times.  But just the 2nd time around they shrunk.  \nIf you go for your first time it seemed like a typical size you would see at other sushi restaurants.  \n\nEveryone was getting impatient.  What happen to their good timing that people didnt seem to notice the timing in between each fish?\n\nI dont know if I will be going back.  \n\nThey have a liquor license now.

Their sushi is unmatched, and truly a secret gem in Vegas.\nAt first glance it would be hard to spot Kabuto, because there are no signs for it at all. The only thing you can distinguish the place is the slim window. But it is in the same plaza as Monta Ramen and Raku.\nDefinitely take the time to reserve ahead of time if you plan to eat here, as their restaurant is small and limited. The restaurant itself is quaint, and simple. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the chefs make your sushi, they are very friendly and know what they are doing.\nThe servers are amazing here! Highly attentive and informative. When your food came, they would explain what you were eating and its place of origin. I must also mention that all of their fish is FRESH! Fresh shipments from the shores of Japan, Korea,Brazil, and a few other places. Expect great quality!\nNow mind you it costs a pretty penny to dine here, so don't expect huge portions. Its more of a place to take your time and enjoy the flavor of each piece of Edomae Sushi.\nAnother thing to note is this place serves Edomae Sushi and fish. No rolls. If you expect rolls, you're better off going to a AYCE place.\nThe dessert is here is also delicious, its all homemade which is unbelievable.\nI don't beleive my words can take this place to justice, you'll have to try it out to see how great it is :)","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Yet you wouldn't know once you enter. The standard metal and glass frame construction, ubiquitous to every strip mall is transformed into a zen like space. A lone minimalist, rectangular window allows people to look in but for those inside, you are totally removed. The interior is clean with ample light and a subdued atmosphere. A perfect setting to enjoy the sublime cuisine which you are about to eat. \n\nWe chose the \"Kabuto\" menu, which contains eight courses for $120 (aperitif sake \/ appetizer \/ sashimi platter (5 kinds) \/ grill platter (5 varieties) \/ nigiri (12pc) \/ hand roll \/ miso soup \/ dessert)\n\nThe first course was their Sake aperitif which was made in house from two types of mash. I've never liked Sake before. Perhaps it's because the ones I had were swill. The aperitif was chilled to the point of ice crystals forming on the top, melon flavours and a slight sweetness with a silky mouth feel. This is one time where I wish I could have supersized my drink.\n\nAfter eating over 20 different items a few highlights are:\n\n- The Golden Eye Snapper was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever eaten. Look for it!\n\n- The Spot Prawn from Santa Barbara was excellent. Slightly sweet, served with real wasabi. \n\n- The Aburi Blue Fin 'triangle' was barely seared, just enough to taste the flavour of the torch; ambrosia of the sea. \n\n- Normally I'm not a fan of Ikura or Salmon Roe. Not wanting to offend the chef, I forced a smile and nodded when he handed us two very generous portions of the roe. As I prepared myself for an oily-kind of fishy-unpleasantness I was surprised at how clean and delectable the roe was. No unpleasantness here. \n\nThe only thing we were served which I did not like was the Spiny Sea Snail. Being served in its large, spiky shell, it did not look appetizing nor inviting. The flesh was tough and rubbery and the size of a finger. The taste was acrid and charcoal like. The chef mentioned Japanese folks love it for its bitterness. My wife almost threw up and this item effected the rest of her meal. If you see a large, spiky shell, just pass. \n\nOverall the meal went from being very good to sublime. The service was quite attentive and the dishes were well explained. For $120 per person, I expect a top notch experience and that is exactly what Kabuto delivered. If you're looking for an authentic sushi experience Kabuto delivers on the level the best in LA or NYC do.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":0}

It's expensive but 100% worth it Japanese food is a type of food that you enjoy.  \n\nI've eaten here twice and my feelings after my meal here were quite different each time. The very first time, I came as a younger version of myself. A broke student with a rather unsophisticated taste for Japanese food. I thought it was good but I'd didn't know exactly why, and I was focused more on how expensive it was than how really incredible the food was. I couldn't really appreciate what I didn't know enough about.   \n\nAfter eating here a second time many years later, I've come to the conclusion that eating is as much a reflection on yourself as it is a reflection of the restaurant. Now a working adult with a ton more experience eating Japanese sushi and food in general, I walked out of this restaurant completely blown away by almost every thing I had. \n\nThe incredibly freshness of all of the seafood, the elegance in each item served, and the service were tops. I absolutely enjoyed everything. We ordered the most expensive omakase though if I were to return I would likely stick to doing nigiri and sashimi a la carte. If you manage to get a seat at the bar which I recommend, the Japanese sushi chefs (when not busy preparing food) were happy to talk a bit about the food. They look really serious but were friendly and polite when I asked them a few things. I think maybe they were more open to chat because I was so visibly happy with my experience there.","useful":6,"funny":2,"cool":4}

We wanted to focus on having raw fish as opposed to the other grill items, tempura, etc. Accompanying our meal was a sake we chose--described as \"soft, lightly sweet\"--but its strong taste wasn't my cup of tea. The sake-mixed drink they present to you in a shot glass of sorts is amazing, though. Wish we could've gotten a whole pitcher of that.\n\nWe ate too many single items for me to go into detail here, but I recommend Kabuto with ALL of my heart. Only wish there was something similar to this in Chicago!\n\nBe sure to make a reservation! You can call 3pm onwards, and ask for a seat at the sushi bar.

That fact that it was off the strip was a bonus because their prices are about 30-40% lower than the strip.

Decor is simple and clean.  We sat at the sushi bar in front of chef Hiro, which turned out to be a big bonus bc he gave us a lot of insights into the food the that was preparing for us.  The sushi:  fresh, high quality, and served at the right temperature.  We tried the $40 and $120 omakase.  The $120 is def the way to go as it was a few levels above the cheaper course in terms of quality.  We also ordered a la carte in addition to the omakase and that was very good as well.  There's also a good variety of sake, many homemade.  We are not big drinkers so did not really enjoy this part of the menu.

In order to do that we need to do some research first before we embarrass ourselves in front of our guests. We follow yelpers' advice and visited this place. \n\nVery pricey ($48) for 10 pcs of nigiri, dessert, a tiny glass of 2% sake and hand roll. The price also goes up to $80 or $120 for a full course meal per person. I ordered the $48 and my husband got the $80 meal. I have to be honest that if you are there to have your stomach filled you should order the $48. No, you're not going to feel full, but you can order extra pcs of nigiri (premium fatty tuna at $7 a pc and the price goes down to $2 for egg nigiri) \n\nThe most impressive thing we had on the menu that day was the extra pcs of kamashita fatty tuna nigiri we ordered separately. NOTE: it wasn't selected by the chef to come with our (I'll leave it to you meal\"). The chef told us there's more marble fat than the premium fatty tuna (same price), it's from the collar of the fish. Not only do they melt in your mouth but it also makes the rice taste amazingly good. Compared to the premium fatty tuna, it's a lot better. The PFT was stringy for both of us. I had to spit out the unchewable bit and my husband took the patience to chew down the stubborn string.\n\nNext thing that left an impression is the raw giant scallop nigiri, it tasted sweet... My husband got the $80 meal but he was not impressed with it. We decided that it wold be better to go with the $48 meal next time so we can have enough money to order separate pcs. The chef are Japanese and it's hard for me to read what they're thinking because they seldom smile at first but after the 4th pc of fish our chef got less serious. But you kind of have to pay close attention to their eyes, they give you very good suggestions to what is good and fresh that day.\n\nMakino AYCE used to be my favorite sushi place but after I had omakase style sushi it ruins Makino for me. I will still go back if I have cravings for sushi and don't have a fat wallet for sushi. Total bill at Kabuto comes out to $176 without tip. This includes us ordering a total of 6 extra pcs of nigiri that did not come with the meal. Overall if it wasn't the price, it was a very fun experience.

And I have been back and forth on my overall opinion.  I finally settled on 2 stars, and I sort of feel I could go in either direction, one higher or lower. But in the end, I am more on the lower side of the rating.  Here is why...\n\nThe short answer:  Food poisoning.  But here is the whole night's thoughts.\n\nMe and a friend came to Vegas for her birthday, which was two days prior.  She picked out a couple restaurants she wanted to go to, and found this place based off of the reviews.  We are always looking for better and better sushi, and this place seemed to fit the bill nicely.  \n\nEveryone was very nice when making reservations, and equally as nice when I called to let them know I may be a little late due to the difficulty I had getting a cab (Fight weekend...should have left much earlier I guess.) Luckily we showed up shortly after 6, not too late at all. We were promptly seated. The setting is really nice.  Very clean and pretty in it's simplicity.  It had a feel of exactly what we hoped for, an authentic high end sushi dinner.  The server was great, very eager to answer questions.  We ordered the Kabuto menu and sat eagerly waiting for the courses to start coming.\n\nThe first \"course\", a chilled sake aperitif, took a while to arrive. That would be my first issue.  I didn't keep my eye on the clock, but it felt like a good 20 minutes after we ordered before anything came out.  I understand they were doing all the prep work for our dinner during that time so things would start coming out in a properly timed fashion once they started serving, so I am not too bothered by this.  But still, I was starting to get pretty hungry.  \n\nBut then the food started coming, and the timing of the service was pretty good.  Courses started coming at a good pace.  Not too fast, not too slow. \n\nNow I have never eaten sushi outside of the U.S. so I can not speak about how authentic everything was.  I have had several omakase sushi experiences before though.  And this one, in terms of how the food tasted, was not one of the better dinners.   Most everything was good.  But that was just it...good.  The nigiri was certainly the best part.  You could tell everything was prepared well from a technical stand point.  And a few pieces of the nigiri were really quite great. But on a whole I was not blown away as I thought I was going to be.  But still it was good. That's about all I can say on the food.  From the start to the end.  Just average.  Not bad, not great.\n\nI may have felt like I paid WAY too much for a mediocre dinner at this point, but I can accept that it just wasn't the right choice for me and not be too bothered by the price.  Until later that night\/next morning.  Around 2 AM my friend started feeling like she was going to be sick.  And around 3 AM she started throwing up.  And she continued on and off until maybe 5 or 6 AM.  My friend has had food poisoning before.  She has a sensitive stomach to tainted food and it hits her quicker that it may some others.  Considering that and the fact that we only had a piece of pizza earlier that day, it was pretty obvious that Kabuto was the source of this problem.  And while she may have  sensitive stomach to food born illness, I have had HUNDREDS of sushi dinners with her over the years, at all sorts of different levels of places.  And I have NEVER seen her actually vomit from sushi before.  She went on to say this was the WORST she had felt from food poisoning.  \n\nHer experience was a 1 for sure.  I would have rated it a 3 or 4, giving a higher mark for service...like I said, they were quite nice and the technical side of the prep was good, and quick when it finally came out.  But having had to help her though the night once she fell ill, I would be more on the side of 3 stars.  So averaging the two together I came to 2 stars for this place.  And that is trying to be fair.  In all honesty, I sort of feel I should just say it was WAY too over priced for mediocre sushi and my friend got really sick from it, short and sweet, and give it 1 star.  But I am trying to give them some sort of benefit of the doubt here.  \n\nBut I am not sure why.  I most certainly will NOT be going back.  Regardless of how sick my friend got...it was really pricey for the Kabuto for mediocre sushi.  I really wish I spent only $48 on the Nigiri menu and didn't go all out for the Kabuto.  Heck, if I did maybe my friend wouldn't have been sick.  Who knows what individual item or items caused the problem.  But at least on the Nigiri menu I would have saved my self $144.","useful":8,"funny":3,"cool":0}

Every time we visit Las Vegas, we make a reservation with Kabuto ahead of time. This time for our 4-day trip we made reservations for two of the nights because they are just THAT good!\n\nWe always order the Kabuto omakase course that comes with appetizer, sashimi platter and grill platter to start. The sashimi platter consisted of five different sashimis, two types of fish, shrimp, scallop and oyster. The shrimp and scallop were super fresh. The grill platter had three types of grilled fish, king crab and scallop with uni. Every single piece was so delicious. Then we get 12 pieces of Nigiri. Each piece is unique and equally delicious. The rice is absolutely amazing and each piece almost melts in your mouth. After the nigiri comes the hand roll which is always my favorite. The warm rice with toro chopped up with scallions wrapped up in crispy seaweed is just so perfect. Even though I'm always so stuffed by the time I get to the hand roll, somehow I still manage to finish it too. \n\nNow let's talk about service. If you have been to Yui Edomae, on a scale of 1(worst) to 10(best), I'd rate Yui's service at -1 and Kabuto at 11. Kabuto's lovely and attentive waitresses pick up each dish after you have finished your food and carefully wipe away any sauce dripped onto the place mat. Yui's waitresses, on the other hand, only collects dishes when there is absolutely no space to put down another dish and completely ignores the drops of sauces on the table. At Kabuto, the waitresses always fills your sake cup proactively while at Yui, we have to serve ourselves all night. At Kabuto, they would ask how your meal is and they are genuinely interested in what you have to say. At Yui, they would ask how your meal is, you can answer \"meh, not so good\" and they just walk away. At Kabuto, you get a pen to sign for your bill and I'm sure they won't mind you taking the pen but be warned if you are in Yui Edomae. If they are missing a pen, the waitress from Yui would public humiliate you by asking you to empty out your pockets to prove to them you haven't taken their pen.\n\nPoint of my story is, GO FOR KABUTO AND STAY AWAY FROM YUI EDOMAE. \n\nCan't wait to go back again!

I'm sure you've read from all the other reviews about the experience at Kabuto. This review focuses on the service\/value, as the food has been covered thoroughly by other yelpers.\n\nService: 5\nFood: 5\nAtmosphere: 5\nReservations: Not required, but in my opinion, a must.\n\nThe server\/client ratio is extremely high, so the average American might be put off by this level of service and might rate it badly (aka: hovering). Try this place out and see what real service is like. They will stand within 5-6 feet of you at all times, which is excellent. The servers are extremely knowledgeable about their menu. I believe both the chefs and the servers are educated on the daily menu. If you have extreme social anxiety, I would avoid this place like the plague. Otherwise, skip the regular tables and reserve a seat at the sushi bar. There are 10 seats at the sushi bar, the one closest to the entrance is 1 (which is where the head chef Gen-san is stationed).  I usually reserve seats 9-10 and ask for Nobu-san. Nobu -san's attention to detail is on par with Gen-san in my opinion and he is less intimidating.\n\nMost valuable way to eat here is to order the $48 omakase and individually order pieces that you liked\/want to try. The yoroi and kabuto dinner is not a good deal for the money. We came here to eat sushi right? Skip the non-sushi items. You'll thank me for it.\n\nTHE DAMAGE: My party of two tried everything on the daily menu at least once, tried a couple of things twice (Boston scallops) and had a couple of sapporos each. Bill came out to $290, and we left there $400 poorer, but infinitely happier.

Will it live up to the hype?  What if I don't like something they serve me?  Will I even KNOW what I'm eating??  These are the questions that ran through my mind, and I have to admit I was a bit nervous.\n\nAs I pondered the menu, I decided the omakase was an amazing opportunity to try lots of new flavors so I just went for it!  We ordered a bottle of Moscato with our meal, and I was pleased with my husband's choice.  We were started off with an aperitif of mango sake made by the chef - it was a perfect little start!  With tiny bits of ice, it was really cold and sweet.  Highly enjoyable!\n\nOur first tasty tidbit was a little salad of sea bass and seaweed.  The sea bass was tender and paired nicely with the seaweed.  I normally don't care for seaweed, but I actually enjoyed the texture of this.\n\nNext up:  sashimi.  There was tuna was from Spain, Tasmanian trout, porgy, and a fourth one I can't remember.  I have no idea what porgy is, but it was so incredibly light and fresh.  All of the fish was fresh with delicate flavors.  Loved it!\n\nNext up, grilled fish served with house-made soy.  The soy was as delicate as the fish with a wonderful lightly smokiness.\n\nNigiri course was next, and I was surprised that the rice was served warm.  When I asked the chef why it was served warm, he said it was \"...from his heart.\"  Awww....\n\nWe enjoyed kitsu (sand boter), ma-aji (jack mackerel), o-toro (premium fatty tuna), and anago (sea eel).  The quality of the fish and the expert preparation made this the best sushi I've ever had.  Ever.  For the first time, I ate my sushi without adding any wasabi or soy.  It didn't need it.  Simply enjoy the delicate flavors and texture.\n\nIncluded in the omakase was soup - my husband & step-daughter enjoyed the fish and I went for the mushroom miso as well as gyoku (sweet omelet).  The gyoku is as delicate as the fish with a hint of sweetness.\n\nWe ordered a few more pieces of sushi and then finished with dessert course.  The almond tofu is a-ma-zing!  My step-daughter enjoyed three different types of mochi:  green tea, vanilla and a fruity flavor (she said it tasted like a pineapple life saver).\n\nLooking forward to our next visit!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":4}

It's just a door, when u get near the door, there's a miniature sign that says Kabuto.  For first timers, they make it seem like you are only allowed to order Omakase, 3 different price levels.  We got the most expensive one, $120 Omakase.  \nBut you don't have to order Omakase, you can order off the sushi menu, which they give you after you order.  The quality of the fish was excellent, but my goodness, the pieces of sashimi and sushi were sooo small!  Even the handroll they give at the end, all very small pieces.  I've had sushi all over the United States, and for the price you pay here they don't give you justice with the fish.  That is why I gave it a 3 and also the fact that you don't have to order Omakase but they make it seem like that's your only option.  I wouldn't go back.","useful":1,"funny":3,"cool":1}

If you truly appreciate the Edomae tradition of sushi, you need to be here.  If you've ever been to Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market you know what I mean.  \n\nLocated in the Chinatown section of LV, in a small strip mall with great aromas from noodle shops and other Asian restaurants, you will easily miss it as the sign and entrance are small and nondescript.  It's worth the effort to find the place though, and you will not be disappointed.  \n\nThey have two seatings each evening at 6:00 and 8:30 in the classically minimalist 22 seat venue.  We were very lucky to get a table by calling ahead the same day. The counter is the place to be as always but we were 3 and happy to have a table.  I was somewhat amused when making the reservation, as she told me it's not good for children, all sushi is raw, no rolls, and no fried items.  I replied \"As it should be\".\n\nThey have an extensive sake menu and I recommend you opt for a higher end offering as it will then be on a par with the food you will receive.  \n\nIt is Omekase style with three price points, the most expensive at $120 and worth every penny.  I am not going to continue with a recitation of the courses.  They are all amazing.  Let's just say they didn't bother to mention that the Wasabi is freshly grated, and that tells you a bit about the quality of the food. \n\nDon't take your friends to this place if they gravitate towards rainbow rolls and tempura, take the friends that are special people in your life (although that may of course include some of the former).  They will love you for it and will have a new perspective on sushi.\n\nP.S.  - I think Jiro would approve of this restaurant.

However,  still a highly pleasurable experience.  I think this place is specially made for couples that can sit in front of their own sushi master.  \n\nThere is nothing like this place in the desert, or on the strip (thankfully not).  We are so lucky to have this unadulterated sushi in the desert.  No question, Kabuto is the place.  So simple you may question why pay so much?  From the attentive service to the detail in presentation, more importantly the fresh fish; there is no sushi experience like it.  Frankly the omakase is a steal. Look at the various menus yelpers post...have you been able to be so specific on the type of species of fish\/seafood you are eating?  With this day and age of mislabeling of fish, dining at Kabuto, you can be assured you are getting  real authentic sushi.  A learning lesson for me, make your reservations early in the evening...once the fish is finished it is 86ed from the menu; by the end of our meal which started at 8:00 pm (the restaurant only opens at 6 pm)  there was only 4 fishes to choose from.  Not disappointed, you know it is fresh and also selective, when it is gone 1\/2 way through dinner service, you know it is good and fresh.  I truly feel privileged to eat here.  My guests from NYC were equally impressed.\n\nFurthermore, one of my guest had a shellfish allergy and they ensure all his sushi remained \"pure\".  He left completely unscathed and raving about the sushi.  \n\nGo! Especially for a special occasion...promotion, birthday, or anniversary.

I prefer Kabuto due to its more minimalist décor and sushi focus. Kabuto offers an omakase, and their Kabuto omakase serves guests a variety of courses to accompany their sushi omakase.\n\nThe Kabuto omakase started with a really good lime sake, which was lightly sweet and refreshing. Next came a really good amuse course. There was very good Bluefin tuna that was marinated in soy and seaweed to give it both a salty and ocean-like flavor; it was garnished with crisp daikon and wakame. The amuse also came with tender octopus topped with julienned radish and sitting in a broth of dashi and really good and slimy seaweed I have only experienced in Japan.\n\nNext up was their sashimi course, and this is definitely where Kabuto did not quite measure up to top Japanese sushi restaurants on the west coast. Both the yellowtail and snapper were not that moist and did not glisten like great sushi. The scallop though was very good, and I liked the Washington state oyster topped with ponzu. The raw sweet shrimp was also good, and I enjoyed the distinct nori paste to accompany the snapper.\n\nThe grilled plate followed, and I really enjoyed it. The preparations were very Japanese. The chef utilized fish choices that you would find in restaurants throughout Japan even though they did not reveal the incredible moistness and flakiness of premium fish choices like black cod found at other high-end U.S. based Japanese restaurants (like Nobu).\n\nSeveral of the fish courses had great garnishes. The meaty yellowtail was topped with a bruleed miso sauce while the ocean trout was finished with a sweet and creamy uni sauce. The seared tuna was cooked too much for my taste and was topped with a soy marinated grated daikon. There was also a quite bitter snail bite and Alaskan snow crab with mushrooms.\n\nThe nigiri courses came next. Some were exceptional while others tasted lackluster compared to the best sushi you would find in the country. Still, there was mostly excellent to very good sushi here. I really liked the silky fatty tuna, which combined the more lean texture of Bluefin tuna with the richness and creaminess of toro. Also very enjoyable was the black snapper brushed with lemon and topped with sea salt and yuzu zest. The hair tail was really good and had similarities to barracuda and mackerel. There was also creamy and sweet Chilean uni and a little bowl of rice and bursting with saltiness and ocean flavor salmon roe. Other nigiri with their omakase included Bluefin tuna (good not great), marbled fatty tuna (good), kohada, and baby yellowtail. There was also a very sweet egg omelet.\n\nI ordered several additional nigiri, and there were some true standouts. I really enjoyed the barracuda. It was nicely seared to give a slight crispiness to the outside as well as make the fish even more moist (great melting of fatty and oily fish). They had 2 additional uni offerings, and I tried both. The Hokkaido uni had a stronger ocean flavor than their omakase uni, and there was also a sweet, very creamy and delicious uni from Santa Barbara.\n\nThere was also a nice golden eel nigiri (very soft) as well as two kinds of ocean trout--the more standard piece and a rich and creamy ocean trout belly. The omakase also featured a toro hand roll and a very good though a little too hot in temperature miso soup. The omakase also came with dessert, and I opted for the strawberry crepes cake, which was satisfying though not remarkable.\n\nService was exceptional--very personable, professional, polished and polite. Prices on their a la carte menu are definitely high. I thought their omakase was reasonable though compared to both omakase restaurants in Los Angeles and tasting menu restaurants in Las Vegas.\n\nKabuto is a very good Japanese restaurant and one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Some of their fish (like their premium toro) may not match up to top sushi restaurants in the country like Nozawa Bar, Sushi Zo or Q Sushi in Los Angeles. That being said, some of their sushi is exceptional and reveals the kind of moisture and flavor that truly elevates this sushi from more standard though still good west coast sushi restaurants. With the skill in the kitchen, the excellent fish and the inclusion of hard to find Japanese ingredients, Kabuto is a restaurant not to be missed regardless of how long your stay is in Las Vegas.\n\nKabuto is located in a dining plaza with very limited parking. Free street parking is available.","useful":29,"funny":9,"cool":15}

Definitely a place for the sushi purists and fins down, my new favorite sushi place in Las Vegas.\n\nKabuto is humble in its appearance - located in a small strip mall in Chinatown you could easily miss this unpretentious gem.  Had it not been for the ray of light emitting from their minimalist rectangular window, I wouldn't even have noticed it was there.  Inside, it's the same.  This humble elegance is a theme in their decor, service, and food.  A sushi counter that seats 10 guests at a time and a few tables of 2 or 4 -- definitely a cozy space for an intimate dinner.  With that said, reservations are necessary.  \n\nThe restaurant serves 3 types of omakase courses and also have a la carte items.  \n[The NIGIRI course] ($48\/person) includes: aperitif sake + amuse + nigiri (10pc) + hand roll + dessert\n[The YOROI course] ($80\/person) includes: aperitif sake + amuse + sashimi (4 kinds) + grill (3 varieties) + nigiri (8pc) + hand roll + miso soup + dessert\n[The KABUTO] ($120\/person) includes: aperitif sake + appetizer + sashimi platter (5 kinds) + grill platter (5 varieties) + nigiri (12pc) + hand roll + miso soup + dessert\n\nMy husband and I both went with the Yoroi course and it was divine.  From start to finish, perfection in all the elements of what defines a great sushi experience.  The restaurant gives you the option to participate in the traditional etiquette of eating sushi with your hands instead of chopsticks and if you do choose to use their chopsticks, it is placed parallel to the diner.  \n\nI am almost in disbelief that a place like this exists and they have managed to keep it free of pretense and glitz.  Kabuto is easily the dining highlight for any of my future trips to Vegas.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3}

Parking is limited and reservation is a must. All the staff and Chefs were professional but I felt like everyone was walking on thin ice. Everybody there appear to be fearful of the Head Chef. No one spoke unless it was to ask if you needed anything or to explain what the dish that they just placed in front of us. I've been to a lot of Sushi places and this was the first one that everyone, Chefs and waitresses appeared to be very rigid. They were all nice but the place didn't feel welcoming; and it's not their fault, I think they were all scared of their Boss. I felt like if you ate in the wrong order or the wrong way, the Chef would refuse further service...kinda like the Soup Nazi from Seinfield. More than once I saw a disapproving shake of the head of the Head Chef when one of the waitress did something and they quickly corrected it. The only guy that talked to us was probably the youngest apprentice and the Head Chef didn't seem very please with him.\n\nSince this place serves Omakase style, many things are not written on the menu. The type of fish may be on a menu but what they put with or on it is not. They do go over each item, but sometimes its a little hard or too fast to understand but I was afraid to ask again because I felt that if I did, I would offend the Head Chef; he didn't smile much and barely talked. I've been to several other Omakase and the Chefs were very talkative, made us feel comfortable, were more than welcome and willing to answer questions and just had fun while serving really great sushi! \n\nIn order to go back to this place... it would have to offer amazing and unique flavors.

What's most upsetting is when you know you could have gone somewhere else or replicated the experience at home at a lesser cost. \n\nHaving said that, I spent a bunch more money than usual on dinner at Kabuto and wasn't mad about it. In fact, I've been looking for the next opportunity that would justify visiting again. \n\nSimply put, a meal here is an experience. I can't replicate this at home because I can't recreate the environment and presentation; and I certainly could not get my hands on the quality and array of sushi I was privileged to enjoy that night.\n\nAs first timers, we decided to go all in by ordering the highest priced omakase course because YOLO. The Kabuto set at $120 per person begins with a warm towel (something seemingly pre-requisite to all things \"baller\" in nature) and includes:\n\nAPPERTIF SAKE\nWe were served a house-made lime sake that was beautifully crisp and clean. Though low in ABV, it was well enjoyed by the table\n\nAPPETIZER\nSliced tuna with sliced radish paired with scallops in a (I think dashi if I remember correctly) broth. I started a personal rule not to eat sushi tuna anywhere not high-end so as to avoid that weird tuna wannabe that wreaks havok on one's stomach. How absolutely wonderful it was to be served this. \n\nSASHIMI PLATTER (5 kinds)\nPerception altering. The sweet shrimp and scallop immediately garnered ear-to-ear grins and ooo's\/ahh's when eaten.\n\nGRILL PLATTER (5 items)\nDelicious. The uni-topped clam and miso-butter salmon were stars. \n\nNIGIRI (12 pieces)\nThis was served in two waves of 5, with a third round that was \"diner's choice\" for the last two pieces. We had a later reservation that night so missed out on being able to choose a few items due to selling out. However, I ended up having tried almost all of the menu. Oh and that O-toro! It easily earned its place as one of my two \"diner's choice\" selections. \n\nHAND ROLL\nWelp, that put other hand rolls to shame. I would say I'm ruined for not-as-fancy sushi, but that's a lie. What I can say is that I appreciate the difference. \n\nMISO SOUP\nWe had a choice from traditional, shrimp head, and mushroom. We had a party of 3 so we tried them all. No complaints here. \n\nDESSERT\nWe ordered one of each choice - strawberry cheesecake, mango sorbet, and black sesame panna cotta. I preferred them in the order listed. \n\nTo this, we added a bottle of sake, which was enough to enjoy with the meal but be not get wasted and have to walk\/lyft\/call a friend home. \n\nThis actually comes out to a satisfying amount of food.  It's obviously not nearly as much food as an AYCE spot, but enough so that I started rallying myself to make it through to the end about halfway through the meal. The meal, by the way, is coursed perfectly so that you're never hungry or too stuffed at any given point. \n\nThe service is exceptional. Our server was warm, attentive, and personable. As already mentioned, she masterfully coursed the meal out so that we never felt rushed or unattended to. Though we had no allergies or dietary restrictions to alert her to, she overheard me joking about how my husband dislikes uni. She immediately stopped by and let my husband know that she would have the chef make alternate arrangements around uni where needed. \n\nOne should be prepared for:\n\n- A very calm atmosphere. The room feels focused and serene. It may have had partly to do with the others' demeanor, but I felt like I was the loud, boisterous person in the room. I felt like I had to calm it down a bit. I also felt weird taking the food porn pics, but I still did it. \n\n- A reservation. Call it in, people. \n\n- The the nightmare that is parking in that strip mall. I'm having anxiety even typing about it. I'm also impatient and cranky behind the wheel so take this for what it's worth. \n\nAt the end of evening, with tax and tip, we paid about $160 each and, as I said, I wasn't mad about it. \n\n#treatyoself","useful":16,"funny":4,"cool":3}

We had an amazing meal at neighboring Raku so our hopes were high.  Kabuto just didn't live up to expectations.  The fish was very fresh but for the price (husband ordered the $80 omikase and I ordered the $120 omikase), the portions were extremely small.  I am a small girl and a fairly light eater and I left with hunger pangs!  And it wasn't like I could order more food, we sat down at 6 and had to be out by 8.  My husband and I eat lightening fast but you can only eat as fast as the server\/chef sends out the food which in our case was extremely slow. By 7:50 we were being rushed out having just swallowed our last bite.  And dessert was a big let down so leaving on that note was a bummer.  I have a sweet tooth the size of the State of Nevada and the custards and ice creams they brought were hardly sufficient to satisfy it.  \n\nAlso, if you are deciding between the $80 and $120 omikase, go with the $80.  The  offerings for the \"kabuto\" $80 Omikase were perfectly fine and didn't seem like a $40 less value than the more expensive alternative.  \n\nFinally, don't go expecting fair prices on alcohol.  Raku had a huge selection of wines and sake and fair prices on beer.  Kabuto charged $6 for a teeny tiny beer and the cheapest and only glass of red wine was $15 while the cheapest sake was similarly priced.  I had two drinks and paid almost $50!\n\nI definitely wouldn't go back.  If in the area, check out Raku instead.","useful":2,"funny":4,"cool":1}

This is the best Edomae sushi restaurant in all of Las Vegas based on food quality, value, and service.\n\nOur Valentine's dinner (Feb. 16, 2017 as my date was working on the 14th) was the $80 Yoroi midrange omakase - chef's choice, prix fixe menu - per person, with no alcohol ordered. It consisted of an 8 course meal, with notables of the braised bluefin tuna that tasted like beef, sweet and firm mirugai sashimi, fresh ground wasabi, and bonefish miso soup.\n\nTips:\n* You can make reservations the day of during the week as they're not full. YMMV during weekends.\n\n* They do not serve sushi rolls, so don't expect them.\n\n* Don't rush through each course. Savor every bite as this is some of the freshest fish you'll taste, being flown in daily.\n\n* If you're not familiar with how to eat something, ask the server. They want to help you eat edomae cuisine correctly. For example, don't drench your sushi in soy sauce, use the hot towel in the beginning to clean your hands, and it's ok to use your fingertips to eat.\n\n* Sweets Raku is next door and great for dessert afterwards (what we did).","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Kabuto definitely has what it takes to do very well in Las Vegas for pure sushi purists. Do not come here looking for an all you can eat menu or specialty rolls with interesting sauces and names. Come here if you are a sushi purist that is looking for quality, fresh fish that rivals some of the best sushi places that I have ever been in LA, SF and all over the country.\n\nI came here with my girlfriend and another friend and was able to share their omakase menu. It was a good opportunity to try the variety that Kabuto has to offer, especially since we came within the first month of opening. I am really looking forward to going back to see how they have progressed. \n\nOmakase menu for $80\nPineapple flavored sake aperitif\nMonk fish liver appetizer\nSashimi selection - tuna from Spain, bonito from Japan, trout from Hokkaido\nWarm\/cooked platter - Kobe beef tataki, grilled conch, barracuda with sea salt\nSushi selection - japanese mackeral, golden big eye snapper, medium fatty tuno (toro), jack mackeral, tomago (with Kabuto branded on top), sea eel\nTuna hand roll\n\nThey also have a sushi nigiri omakase for $48. I think the next time I would just order a la carte and try as many of the fresh fish that they have (typically about 20-25 pieces) that are flown in on a daily basis. The other interesting part of Kabuto is that they do not have the typical layout of most sushi places where you have a refrigerator sitting in front of you at the bar. Instead, they have a traditional japanese box of fish that is what they serve daily. Its in a glass case and if they run out, then you are out of luck for that fish that day. According to many sushi chefs that I have talked to, this is a very traditional Japanese way of serving sushi.\n\nOverall, I will definitely go back and visit Kabuto again. As much of a sushi snob that I admit to being, Kabuto definitely is a place that I will frequent and recommend to anyone looking for fresh fish in Las Vegas.","useful":7,"funny":3,"cool":4}

Blah blah blah, I got us a Friday reservation at 7:30 on Tuesday.....But I stopped listening to Vegas critics for anything other than information on new venue openings, their silly dithering about the fabulocity of every 'Strip Trap'; as if simply transplanting restaurants from other cities gives any sustenance\/foundation to urban fabric of this somewhat 'tragically hip' enclave of lost souls...\n\nFrom the outside, there's little indication regarding the nature of the restaurant, much less signage-it's minimal and bare to almost a fault, if one didn't really look at it and realize it's beauty: a narrow elongated window with carefully placed ceramics for a sneak peak inside, a slatted glass door alludes a faint reference to a Japanese vernacular. With such a stark facade, you almost respect the 180 degree decision to it's purity, especially in a city that indulges in over-the-top, more is better, gaudy and misaligned designed restaurants.  It's almost a religious experience with its alter to Gods of the ocean, thus we entered into the temple of Sushi!  Upon entering gated doors, you step into a different world: minimal yet a bright interior unfettered with clutter with every ornament meticulously placed.  It's as if you've entered into an art gallery, an immediate volume of space creating mood and attitude that the food commands, screaming: 'PAY ATTENTION!!!'\n\nWith only twenty seats in the entire restaurant, it's more of a boutique than a restaurant, referencing a cultural crossover imported straight from Japan.  As it's always preferable to sit at the counter, a repoire with the Sushi Chef will further inform and enlighten the experience; some explaining and background is necessary when it come to the various fish species and it's origins.\n\nThere are two prix-fixe omakase courses to choose from, which the only difference is a couple of appetizers in the beginning followed by the same Nigiri Sushi course afterwards.  We opted for the full Monty, with some Nigiri requests after the course to get a full spectrum of the Chef's hand.\n\nThe course commences with an aperitif: Mango Sake chilled with Ice.  Light, sweet but surprisingly refined with no sugary, headache inducing coma after ten minutes.  In addition, we ordered sake to accompany the meal: 'Sato No Homare' a Junmai Gingo Grande; a premium Sake that is well balanced, crisp and fruity, the texture and aroma compliment each other as well as the Sushi.\n\nThe first course starts us off with a cold dish, Giant Clam and Geso (Squid Tentacles) along with Cucumber and a summer sprout called 'Jyunsai' - Water Shield.  This dish focuses heavily on the textural combination rather than punches of flavor.  \n\nThe second course directed us right into the main attraction, fish in it's purist form: Sashimi.  It's with this dish we get to inspect, (more like admire) the quality of fish Chef has selected for the evening; it's here, we observe the knife technique in the slices resembling patterned fabric-racing lines ingrained into the flesh, visuals of swift moving fish come to mind as it's presented so elegantly.\n\n'Umimasu' - Ocean Trout\n'Chinu' - Snapper\n'Katsuo' - Bonito\n\nFor the next course: we move onto the heavier protein dishes.  From the left: Lettuce wrapped in Kobe Beef, 'Kochi' Saikyo Miso Yaki - Flathead grilled Saikyo style with Miso and Grilled Hiramasa - Yellowtail Amberjack in a light Soy.  And even the proteins had a heavier consistency than any other dishes, they were subtle in flavor and the textures were brought to the forefront of the palate - I would even say that was most memorable: from the chilled thin slices of raw beef, the succulent slivers of fish moist with Miso savoriness and rich tender Grilled Yellowtail, hearty with fat and Soy.\n\nAnd finally  the Piece de Resistance, the Sushi: I would try and explain each piece to you, but it would be impossible for a novice like me to be in any way accurate, so as I used to say back when I worked as a Bartender in NY, 'it's just YUMMY'!.....that seemed to enough for everyone...although, they were also drunk...\n\n'Ishigaki Tai' - Spotted Knifejaw\n\n'Hiramasa' - Yellowtail Amberjack\n\n'Ma Aji' - Jack Makerel\n\n'Chu Toro' - Medium Fatty Tuna\n\n'Ikura' - Salmon Roe\n\n'Engawa' - Fluke Mustle Fin\n\n'Uni' - Sea Urchin flown from Hokkaido that morning!\n\n'Chikamenkintoki' - Long Finned Bull Eye\n\n'Suzuki' - Branzino \n\n'Renko Dai' - Deep Sea Porgy\n\n'Kohada' - Shad\n\n'Ma Saba' - Japanese Mackerel\n\n'O-Toro' - Premium Fatty Tuna\n\n'Kamashita' - Kamashita Fatty Tuna\n\n'Negi Toro Maki'\n\nKabuto served an incredible experience; a first class meal paralleling that to any Sushi experience from world class cities...New York, LA, be aware; Vegas has a  culinary force that cannot be ignored!!!","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Everything from the aperitif pineapple sake that is house-made, to the meticulously prepared sashimi, grilled items, and nigiri, to the dessert course with green tea ice cream and house-made mochi was exceptional. This is traditional edomae sushi, so don't expect deep fried rolls or tons of mayonnaise-based or spicy sauces. The sushi chefs at Kabuto keep things very simple to let the taste of the incredibly fresh fish come through. \n\nThe atmosphere may take a bit getting used to for those unfamiliar with traditional Japanese sushi restaurants. It is quiet, and it may be a bit daunting for diners who are not used to having to eat under the watchful eye of their own sushi chef. We were a party of 2 and were seated at the sushi bar, and enjoyed the individual attention of both the chef and the server, who was very knowledgeable and introduced each dish to us thoroughly. Everyone working in the restaurant is Japanese, so it is very authentic. \n\nI will agree with the other reviews that the cuts of fish are a little smaller than I have had at other high end sushi restaurants, however it did not take away at all from our meal, and both of us left the restaurant completely stuffed. \n\nOverall, Kabuto is an incredible dining experience and I will definitely be back.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1}

So here's what happened... Kabuto was one of the restaurants my husband and I were really looking forward to. Even before driving down from LA, we made a list of spots we wanted to hit up and this was at the top. So we called in advanced to make reservations specifically for Omakase at the sushi bar, I repeat, at the sushi bar. The reason is because if we are going to pay top dollar for Omakase, we want to get the full experience at the bar with the chefs. So the hostess on the phone said that the bar was full but that she can put us on the waiting list for the sushi bar and if a spot opens, she will call us back. So we agreed. \n\nSome time passes, and to our delight, we received a call from her and she said, \"Good news! Another party has cancelled and there are two spots available at the bar for 8:30pm.\" We were very excited at this point and arrived on time. Upon arrival, we walk in, they greet us, and find our name but leads us to a table. We mention that we were told our reservation was for the bar but the lady seating us said that those seats were already reserved. And we explained that those were, in fact, our seats due to another cancellation. But she apologized and kept insisting that they were reserved for another party. We asked if they could check with the hostess that helped us on the phone but she was already off her shift. So here we were, sitting at the table, deciding if we wanted to stay or not, and we looked over at the two seats at the sushi bar, which were empty... because they were our seats. The staff looked confused and didn't know what to do. So after 10-15 minutes had passed (with our seats still empty, mind you), we decided to take our business elsewhere. Obviously, there was poor communication and negligence with reservations by the staff.  \n\nWe really didn't want to give this one star but when a restaurant does not honor your reservations and fail to make up for their mistake, it leaves a bad taste (or in our case, no taste) in our mouth. We hope to give Kabuto another chance the next time we're in Vegas so that we can actually try their food and give a complete review.","useful":5,"funny":5,"cool":2}

If you enjoyed the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you will appreciate this restaurant.\n\nThe first thing they served was homemade sake- tasted so sweet and refreshing. I wish there were more! The sushi is so fresh and made with such grace and delicacy. Fish we had that night were flown in from Spain and Japan. The chefs washed their hands each time they touch the rice, fish and brushes- what an art form. The fatty tuna- o toro, was my fave. Can't remember what the other fish were- the chef chose wha we'd have. Chefs were not only skilled, but really friendly to talk to. \n\nThe strawberry crepe cake is HEAVEN. One of the best desserts I've ever had. The top part is brulee, so there's this delicate crunch when you dig into the soft, creamy layers. The cream is not too sweet and rich, and taste like strawberry pocky. I'm drooling as I write.\n\nService was excellent, considerate and impressively well mannered. Waitresses watched us like hawks behind our backs. The second our plate was empty, they cleared it up! Chefs bowed before serving and each time we complimented them. They kept the flow of food at a good pace. Didn't feel comfortable taking pics of the food since we sat in front of the chefs.\n\nAmbience is very zen like, lots of warm colored pine wood, and remarkably clean. Chefs keep their stations so immaculate. Everything in there is beautiful. Even the mats, all white with a painted shrimp in the corner, looked like artwork. Glad I didn't drip anything on there, even though it's probably thrown away afterward. The attention to detail is reflected from the food to the handmade origami toothpick holder.  It's like a museum in there- spotless, with live art, culture and history. \n\nSome tips:\n\nNo restaurant name outside. It's a white color wall with a long rectangular window. The person on the phone was very specific about where it was so we had no trouble recognizing it.\n\nGo on a weekday and make reservations. There' only 8-10 seats at the bar and ~2 other tables. We went on a Wed night and made last minute reservations. Luckily there weren't much people around. \n\n$48 menu is enough for me! I had the $80 menu, but it was too much food! My bf had the $48 one and was really full too. I was dumbfounded by the time they gave me the miso soup and handroll (they keep the seaweed perfectly crispy), I was so full by then, but had to finish it while it was fresh!

It changed my life. I look forward to telling you about it...\n\nYes -- This restaurant is OFF THE STRIP. \n\nYes -- This restaurant requires a reservation because of how busy they can be. \n\nYes-- This restaurant is expensive, but it will change how you look at sushi. \n\n\nNow that we got the basics covered...\n\nTHE RESTAURANT\n--------------------------\n\nThe restaurant maybe seats 24 people at most, they have tables, but there is almost no point of going unless you are seated at the sushi bar.    \n\nAlmost every party at the sushi bar got their own sushi chef. \n\nThis sushi chef will help determine the order of which your sushi will come out to pace your palette accordingly. \n\nOurs was an expert. \n\nTHE FOOD\n-----------------\n\nWhen it comes to sushi, most people don't know that the quality and treatment of the rice is almost as important as the quality and the treatment of the fish. \n\nIts hard to imagine tasting better rice or fish.\n\nAll of the fish was extraordinary. Buttery, smooth, soft, luscious, rich, pick your adjective, it doesn't matter, some of the TORO I ate was some of the sexiest, most delicious bites of food I have ever had in my life. \n\n\nSERVICE\n-----------------\nImmaculate.\n\nNot much more needs to be said. \n\nMichelin star quality.  \n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n------------------------------\n\nBe prepared to spend over $100 per person and order every cut of TORO they have, which is four or five! I guarantee you will most likely never try anything that tastes like this again. \n\nMy favorites were the Hagashi Toro, and Yamashito Toro. \n\nAlso the Iced Green Tea is a must, it is the most refreshing drink you will ever taste. \n\n\nGo. But don't tell too many people, because its too good, and the more people who try it, the busier they will be, the harder it will be for us to get back in. \n \n\nNOTES\n-------------\n\nI am omitting some of the incredible detail, like the quality of their handmade soy sauces and actual wasabi they use as opposed to the fake wasabi many lower grade sushi restaurants use. \n\nFinal Note. Expect Excellence. You won't be let down.","useful":11,"funny":3,"cool":9}

For the same meal, it definitely would have been over $100 in NYC.

I freaking love this place, the food was delicious, the service was impeccable and the price was pretty reasonable for an omakase meal.  \n\nWe opted for the $80 omakase course, I really wanted to do the $120 one, but really didn't think I can finish that much food.  I was right, I was incredibly stuffed at the end of the meal.  For the $80 course, you get aperitif sake, amuse, 4 kinds of sashimi, 3 grill varieties, 8 piece of nigiri, a hand roll, miso soup and dessert.\n\nLet's start with the aperitif sake, it was super light, I think only 4% alcohol, slightly sweet, very refreshing and a perfect way to start the meal.  My husband wanted to order a carafe of it, but I've decided to opt for a carafe of Nanbubijin instead, which was the perfect sake to accompany our ensuing meal.\n\nI won't bore you by listing all of the courses, but will just highlight some of my favorites.  Out of the four different kind of sashimi, the oyster was hand's down the best piece, it was lightly seasoned and tasted extremely fresh, as if it was plucked right out of the sea.  With regard to nigiri, I was obsessed with the itoyori bream, which I've never had before.  It was heaven on Earth, the beautiful piece of fish was lightly brushed with a sauce and lime shaving.  I loved it so much that I've asked for an additional piece, which was a bargain at an additional $5.  The Japanese mackerel was a close second.  My least favorite course was the miso soup, which had the option of bone-in fish or mushroom.  We tried one of each and neither was something to write home about.\n\nThe presentation of the courses was beautiful, I loved the small bowl that served the ikura.  There was an average of one sushi chef per two guests at the bar, which meant you got undivided attention, while the servers appeared to have an average of 4 guests each.  The service was prompt but unobtrusive.  \n\nOverall, it was a great dining experience, it was one of my favorite meals out of our one week trip to CA and LV.  In a city with numerous dining options, I feel like Kabuto wins for both quality and value.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Having recently visited Tokyo, I can appreciate the preparation and pride this restaurant takes in their food. The sushi and sashimi here can stand up to many of the fine establishments in Tokyo and the price at Kabuto is very reasonable for the quality you receive. They are passionate about the way their food is presented and inspect each piece of fish carefully before serving. Any sushi pro knows that not only is the fish an important aspect of sushi but the rice is equally if not more important. The rice was prepared very well (warm with a slight hint of vinegar). The taste of the rice complemented the fish so well it makes my mouth water thinking of it now. The service was friendly and the servers were helpful in educating the patrons on where each food item came from. In case you didn't already know, they receive their products fresh daily from all over the world. One place that they receive their fish from is the famous Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. The fish here meets the standards of fish sold right at that market. The chefs prepare each plate as a piece of art and the timing of each food item is perfect. If you are a foodie and like traditional Japanese sushi then you must check this place out. No cream cheese and spicy mayo rolls here! In my opinion there is no other sushi restaurant in Vegas that is close to Kabuto. That includes the big names on the strip.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

This is the best dining experience I've had in years - fortunately I had the chance to go twice in one week. \nTo preface the experience you have to ignore the strip mall it's contained within - it's typically unappealing - so there's that. Once you enter the realm of Kabuto though - all bets are off - this is a first-class joint. Simple design and layout which can only handle a certain amount of people at the sushi bar and tables. I'll guess the designer\/chef planned it this way - because nothing else is left to chance in this venue.\nThe attention paid to you as you sit down - from the warm towels to the way the servers approach is simple but elegant.\nThere are 3 fixed price meals offered - I stuck with the basic - this meal is NOT about getting filled to the brim so much as getting great food and a memorable aesthetic experience. If you frequent all-you-can-eat sushi places don't come here looking to make a comparison - you're the wrong demographic.\nThe fish\/sushi\/nigiri offered here is beautifully fresh and presented like the treat that it is. The tastes are to be savored. The differences are subtle - but exquisite. It just occurred to me that if you drink Big Gulps or Diet Coke or Mountain Dew often - these tastes will probably not appeal to you.\nThe meal consists of about a dozen pieces of nigiri handed to you in perfect synchrony with your personal timing...I don't know how they do that - except by paying attention to you and your dining experience. There are other dishes they serve - one with fish eggs over rice, an egg thing, a small tuna wrap, a cold sake and dessert that make up the remainder of the meal. \nThis review is not as specific as it can be - basically because the mode of the encounter, if you let it wash over you, is unlike any you will find in all but the best restaurants on earth.\nEnjoy!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Firm.\n\nSurely enough, this place is not for those who like California rolls. They don't serve these westernized rolls. Pretty traditional. \n\nDon't get fooled by their 'presentation' because it's for people who watched the movie on Jiro (btw, Sukiyabashi Jiro is NOT the best in Japan. Fuck no). \n\nSushi here is decent and fresh. Chefs are honest and knowledgeable - They will tell you where the fish is coming from. \n\nThey often have Kawahagi, file fish that belongs to Tetraodontiformes, that is, blow fish. However, Kawahagi has nothing to do with infamous poisonous Fugu (blow fish). So, don't worry about getting poisoned to death. Kawahagi doesn't taste like Fugu at all. Don't get fooled when sushi chef says it is a blow fish because it isn't. (I had fugu in Tokyo several times. Great stuff, btw). \n\n$7 for fatty tuna is a steal. They are pretty good,,, and actually cheaper than Japan. I remembered I paid like $40 for a piece of fatty tuna in Ginza district Tokyo. It was great. But fatty tuna here is pretty good for the price (Sushi place in Narita airport in Tokyo even charges like 10 or 15 for a piece of fatty tuna or salmon roe).\n\nMedium fatty tuna (chu-toro) is better. \n\nAkami is really great. Zuke is even better. \n\nSalmon roe is GREAT. After eating the real salmon roe here, you can't go back to all-you-can-eat place or izakaya style bar because then you feel like you are eating fishing baits.\n\nWell, everything is good here. If you don't know much about traditional sushi, they have a course menu that is only $80. So, no worry. \n\nTamago was only negative that I had. Not perfect. I've had a better tamago. Maybe it's not their fault. It's just hard to find good eggs here in Vegas. \n\nAnd one more thing - yes, portion (of the rice, sumeshi)  is really small. It's so small that you may feel like you are eating sashimi, not sushi. I wish they put, like 20%, more. \n\nDessert was pretty OK. Japanese style - not too sugary. \n\nService is good. \n\nI do not compare this place to any sushi bars in Japan. It is not fair. But I still think this place is pretty good. JUST GO TO THIS PLACE!","useful":12,"funny":0,"cool":5}

Say 10-12 years ago, these places would have probably died off, because nobody's going to venture this far outside of the glitz to find food, but thanks to the internet these joints actually have a chance to survive and thrive. So, first off, a big pat on the back for those of us who venture forth!\n\nNow onto the food. I don't usually throw down 5 stars, because I think people have a pretty binary way of writing reviews. Either they love a place to death and the give it a 5, or something ticked them off and they slap down a 1. I like to save my 5s for places that, once I've been there, if you tell me that you're making a run to go to this place, I will never refuse to join you.\n\nThis is one of those places. We arrived in Vegas at like 7:30 on a Thursday, and asked for reservations on Friday. They said they had none. I asked if they had reservations for tonight, and they said they did. Booya. We made the down to Spring Mountain and our party of 3 was graciously seated in this restaurant that maybe could fit 15 people on a good day.\n\nProbably because of this, they generally try and have you choose from one of their 3 tasting courses: Nigiri, Yoroi, or the third one that I forgot. I opted for the yoroi, while my friends who had been there before decided to save their stomachs for ordering a la carte stuff and opted for the nigiri.\n\nPretty much everything they put out there was tasty (though I wouldn't necessarily recommend eating most of the edible arrangements. I'm not a big fan of shiso leaf, personally.) and some of the things were well beyond what I was expecting.\n\nI generally HATE uni. I've described the taste to my friends as \"tripping while walking along the beach and falling into the sand with your mouth open.\" Vaguely salty, with a high chance of particulate matter. All that with the disconcerting texture of limp egg custard. What's not to love, right? Well, here at Kabuto, the uni was tolerable. Which means that everyone who actually likes it will probably find that it's amazing.\n\nThe other thing that is super amazing here is the toro. Generally, if you see bluefin on the menu, it's a bad thing. Bluefin tuna are being hunted to extinction in the Pacific by greedy fisherman. Spanish bluefin have made a healthy comeback due to responsible practices, and so I'm trusting that everyone is being above board on this. The chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) was really, really good. It's what would be served as \"fatty tuna\" everywhere else I've been. But they had two grades that were even fattier, including jabara-toro, which is apparently the fattiest part of the fish. Looking at it, it seemed more like well marbled steak than it did fish. It may actually be too rich for me, but you gotta try it once.\n\nFor dessert, they served me black sesame ice cream with sea salt and roasted sesame seeds. A great meal. Will definitely be back.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I had some luck getting last minute reservations on a Tuesday evening, but have tried previously on a weekend and did not have any luck when I called a few days ahead. They give you the option of choosing a tasting menu (Nigiri - $48, Yoroi - $80, Kabuto - $120). The bf and I opted for the Kabuto course since we really didn't know the sushi well enough to pick a la carte. Some yelpers recommend you choose the Nigiri course and then add a la carte what you want, but if you aren't as familiar with the sushi you should definitely choose the Kabuto option! The chef also lets you choose two fish off the menu after the tasting, so you get to try anything you liked twice or opt for a new item. Overall, our dining experience was wonderful. The fish was the freshest fish I've ever had. My favorite was the marbled fatty tuna and the spotted mackerel. They ship their fish in daily from Chile and\/or Japan. They serve Miso soup at the end, and I was so glad they did that! I was so full off my Kabuto course that I barely had room for the soup. The chef was kind enough to tell me to take a few sips to balance the \"cold\" fish. Seriously, a great meal!!!\n\nThe waitress was great and attentive. She gave us great recommendations around which sake to drink with our fish. She was very attentive, but not encroaching. \n\nOverall, a great experience.

If you need a primer on edomae style sushi, check out the recent documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi or Anthony Bourdain's pilgrimmage to Jiro's sushi bar in Tokyo available on youtube (keywords bourdain and jiro).  The fish is so fresh, the chef has most of them stored in a glass case available for display at the sushi bar with the slightest bit of cooling underneath and it is sliced moments before he brushes 5-year aged shoyu(soy-sauce) and dabs a streak of hand-ground wasabi in the most perfect ratio before being consumed in your mouth by hand (chopsticks may break the warm vinegar rice that beautifully complements the room-temperature fish).   I won't go into each component of the meal in detail since it varies depending on what's fresh on any given day, but the general format for their omakase ($80) is a palate cleansing aperitif (pineapple sake made in house in our case), appetizer (ours was monkfish liver AKA the \"fois gras of the sea\") 6 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of nigiri, a trio of grilled items, handroll, soup, and desserts made in house. The nigiri package is 10 distinct pieces of nigiri for $48.\n\nTo have a front row seat at the bar watching the artistry of the preparation and plating of each dish as well as the virtuosity of the chefs' knife-work is a thing of beauty.  So much can be said to the impeccable level of detail given to the dining experience including selection of fish (largest\/freshest sweet shrimp I have ever tasted), personal touches (each individual piece of tamago was seared with their logo on top), and the intensity of flavors (even the peripheral players such as the pickled ginger, fresh-ground wasabi and the ice cream within their handmade mochi and might I mention the bill arrived with homemade toothpicks packaged in an origami creation and the pen used to sign the credit card was a wooden ballpoint matching the cedar wood panel of the table!) In contrast, the actual decor of the place is devoid of pretentiousness located in the Monta\/Raku\/Big Wong square behind an unmarked door and thin slit of a window and minimalist modern decor seating 10 at the bar and 2 tables of four so as to avoid distraction towards its stars: the chef and his ethereal creations.  Like one of my greatest omakase experiences in San Francisco, this one definitely ranks up in my top 5 and my only disclaimer is that this could potentially forever ruin one's future sushi experiences in Vegas and beyond.  If I were a samurai about to commit seppuku or hari kari, I deem this a worthy final meal.","useful":15,"funny":6,"cool":12}

Maybe the best sushi restaurant in Las Vegas ONLY, and that's because there's not that many \"traditional\" Japanese sushi restaurants in Las Vegas in general (I wouldn't consider something like Nobu to be traditional). Another reason for the high review might be because most people that go to this restaurant are tourist from other states that lack traditional sushi restaurant. \n\nI live in LA and been to almost all the traditional sushi restaurants. This place is not even on my top 5. For the people that really wants good sushi and is in the LA\/OC area go to Shunji, Mori Sushi, Sushi Zo, Yamakase, Ohishima, Nozawa Bar, or Shunka. Any of these places are better.\n\nLook, people need to understand that when they go to a $$$$ omakase sushi restaurant the fish that they serve you by DEFAULT should be FRESH! It is a given. If a reviewer mention that the fish is fresh at a $$$$ sushi restaurant, you might as well skip the review, because that person doesn't really know sushi.\n\nA $$$$ sushi restaurant should be judge on the way the sushi is PREPARED! How the fish is CUT or MARINATED, or how much fresh wasabi or lemon juice was put on the fish so as to balance and bring out the flavor of the fish. Also as another reviewer mentioned, the temperature of the rice is important. The temperature of the rice should be consistent on each piece(for this place almost every other piece the temperature was different ranging from warm to cold, and keep in mind I ate every piece around the same time frame). There's many other examples.\n\nIf the chief kill a live fish in front of you and cut a slice for you to eat, BUT put too much wasabi on it, you wouldn't say omg it taste so good because it's fresh, you would complain about the wasabi throwing off the taste!\n\nHonestly this place is not bad for Las Vegas standard and budget. To get this level of food on the strip will definitely cost you more. \n\nService is excellent as should a $$$$ sushi restaurant should be. That's why combine with the sushi this place earns 3 stars. I would give this place 2 star if it was located in  LA.\n\nLast note, the chiefs here serve the sushi too quickly. I wasn't even done eating my sushi and he already has the next piece ready in his hand. The chief should pay attention to the customer and only make the next piece when the customer is done eating. I'll probably try this place again in 5 years. I personally feel the chiefs are not experience enough. All 3 chiefs looked like they are only in their early 30s. Oh they also pre-cut all the fish that was in the omakase. The only ones that's not pre-cut are the ones I order after the omakase option.","useful":10,"funny":3,"cool":5}

Well I've been regretting never having heard of Jiro when I visited Ginza. Definitely had my way with the food in Japan but still...regret. Anyway, imagine my excitement when I heard of Kabuto. And here in Las Vegas! The chefs supposedly hail from the same sushi community as Jiro. Not the same in notoriety but I bet that they take the same pride in their craft. Kabuto claims the fish is just about as fresh, if not fresher, than Jiro's and without the heftier price tag. So if you are a true lover of fish (not the AYCE-sauce-up-my-rolls kind), Kabuto is the real deal.\n\nThe place was a bit hard to find since it does not have an overhead sign. It's a small sushi bar that only seats up to 18 people so I would suggest making reservations. Ordered the omakase which at $80 a person, is a great value for the freshest fish in town. The menu varies depending on what assortment of fish is fresh that day. The bar is at table level so you can actually watch your seafood being selected and prepared. What makes this place stand out even more is that there's no clunky refrigerating system at the bar. The produce is in a case which I can only describe as a large box of fishy goodness. \n\nThe meal began with an aperitif of cold sake homemade by the head sushi chef. I was told it contains very little alcohol and is aged for a minimum of six months. There are several rotating flavors and I had peach that evening. Light and sweet, a perfect start to my meal. \nOmakase also includes an appetizer, sashimi, 10 pieces of nigiri, miso soup and dessert. The  sashimi plate had 4 different types of fresh fish. Eat the light fish first and make your way to the darker meat. Each masterfully-made nigiri is meant to be eaten as soon as it is served. Everything that was set in front of me was absolutely divine but the standouts of the evening were the chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) and the anago (sea eel). Both just melt in your mouth.

This is definitely the only authentic edomae sushi I have experienced in Vegas and a real gem and a great value.  Although I got the kubota omakase ($120) which included a sashimi and a grilled course, I would actually go with the nigiri omakase ($50?) and just add some nigiri next time which is the real attraction for me.  \n\nThe gilled course was decent but nothing that stood out as special since most was precooked and a bit dry.  The star is the nigiri for sure.  The kamashita was a deliciously marbled piece of spanish blue fin tuna from the near the collar of the fish.  I preferred it over the o-toro, which can be a tad stringy and not as melt in your mouth as the kamashita.  Service was excellent and attentive.  I would definitively compare this experience favorably with sushi meals we have had in Tokyo and this is much cheaper than that.  I would say my only complaint was that the rice, although flavorful, was a bit too warm for my taste.  I prefer the rice to have the just above room temperature warmth so that it can just barely warm the natural fish fats, but this was just a bit too warm in my opinion.  Also, when the rice is too warm, the rice also tends to be a tad softer, which doesn't lend itself to having the texture I prefer.\n\nHaving been lucky enough to had tried a few authentic edomae sushi ya's in the US and in Japan, I would definitely stack this up very favorably with those experiences.  If you look at your other choices for complete rip-offs in Vegas such as barMasa or Nobu (we haven't been to either but the pictures and yelp reviews tells me all I need to know that those places do not even come close to the quality at Kabuto at 10x the price).\n\nMy recommendation is make a detour from the strip for this humble little sushi-ya where you can get great sushi at a very reasonable price.  Get yourself here now before the word continues to spread, because I am sure that they could be charging 50% more and people will still pack the place.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When the Michelin Guide returns to Las Vegas, this restaurant is worthy of multiple Michelin stars. You may search many places in many cities, but it is unlikely that you will find truly pure sushi like what you will find at Kabuto. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that is served here melts in your mouth. The fish is to die for and I have often found that I am ruined after my meals that I have had here. There just isn't any other sushi restaurant that lives up to Gen-san's, short of spending thousands of dollars to fly to Ginza to eat at Sukiyabashi Jiro.

It is not purposely modified to fit the non-Japanese palate which means that this place offers sushi in its truest sense. The entire experience at Kabuto accurately reflected our experience at a high end sushi restaurant in Tokyo, except that Kabuto is in Las Vegas and not Tokyo. If you're looking for maki rolls that come with mayo or some sauce that detracts from the freshness and taste of the fish, then Kabuto is not the place for that. But if you want to taste and experience true fish quality, then Kabuto is the place to be.\n\nKabuto is owned by the sushi chef Gen-san, a very pleasant man who takes his sushi craft seriously. Most of the seating is at the 10-seater sushi counter with the usual light colored Japanese wood. There are 3 tables but if possible, request for counter seating for a true experience. Behind the counter against the wall, is one large ikebana (Japanese flower art arrangement). The menu here is omakase only (chef's choice) with three different price points. Different fish are flown in daily and the omakase meal is based on that day's fish varieties. \n\nWe went with the $85 option per person which came with an apperitif, sashimi, grilled items, 8 pieces of nigiri, and dessert for each of us. At the beginning of the meal, a sheet listing the many types of fish they had for that day was placed in between us so that we could refer to their Japanese and English names as each item was served to us. The fish was extremely fresh and of very high quality. Gen-san served sushi like the way it should be and like the way it is done in Japan. We saw each piece of sushi prepared in front of us and after each nigiri was prepared, he placed it with his hand onto each our plates that sat in front of us on the counter. Soy sauce is already brushed onto the fish when the sushi is prepared, just like the way it should be done and also done in Japan. This is so that the right amount of soy sauce goes onto the fish. So there is no need for the guest to dip the nigiri in soy sauce. After he placed a piece of nigiri onto our plates, we picked it up and ate it. He then prepares our next piece of nigiri and the cycle repeats. Before we moved on to dessert, we were asked by Gen-san if we wanted to add any ala carte sushi items from their list of daily fresh fish. The daily list was pretty impressive with many different types of fish that we've not heard. Since it was impossible for all of them to be included in our omakase meal, we each added and ala carte nigiri just so that we could try one of the unique fish on the list. We were given two options for dessert and we each went with the mochi ice cream. The desserts are made in-house by their Japanese pastry chef. According to Gen-san, the mochi is also made in-house and it uses Japanese sugar so the dessert is not too sweet.\n\nWe had a fantastic and very truly authentic experience at Kabuto. This place is a high priority for us to visit again during our next trip out to Vegas!","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Specializing in edomae sushi, per their website, you will have course after course of deliciously prepared sushi set before you. Most are pre-dressed so all you need to do is consume said deliciousness. The few pieces that are not pre-sauced are served to you with dressing (mostly soy sauce) with instructions on how to best consume them :D \n\n\nThe three Omakase sets they offer:\n\n\nNIGIRI -- aperitif sake \/ amuse \/ nigiri (10 piece) \/ hand roll \/ dessert\n\nYOROI -- aperitif sake \/ amuse \/ sashimi (4 kinds) \/ grill platter (3 varieties) \/ nigiri (8 piece) \/ hand roll \/ miso soup \/ dessert \n\nKABUTO -- aperitif sake \/ appetizer \/ sashimi platter (5 kinds) \/ grill platter (5 varieties) \/ nigiri (12 piece) \/ hand roll \/ miso soup \/ dessert \n\n\nWe chose to have the YOROI Omakase and most of it was  delicious. To start, the -APERITIF- sake (made in house) was light, refreshing, and addictive. We should've ordered extra! The -AMUSE- of squid and octopus was a perfect start to awaken our appetites. The -SASHIMI- plate was SO good. I could've had another and another and another until I exploded. Lol. The -GRILL- platter was a huge let down! The first piece of fish I had was good, but the one in the middle was a fish cake of some sort and was super dry and unappetizing. The last piece I tried had an uni sauce which was surprisingly super sweet, almost too sweet. Plus the pieces of fishbone I almost choked on was NOT appreciated. Immediately I thought to myself, 2 stars! But once I popped the -NIGIRI- pieces into my mouth, all was forgiven. Heavenly pieces of perfectly sliced fish atop a pillowy bed of rice. Heaven better include nigiri or I'm not going! Just saying ;p I do wish their rice was better seasoned though because it was sticking to the inside of my mouth. A touch more vinegar could've easily remedied this problem. -HAND ROLL- for the evening was toro and it was again, delicious. I need a new adjective. Haha. For the -MISO SOUP- portion we had a choice between mushroom or fish with bones and I chose the mushroom for obvious reasons. NO MORE FISH BONES!! Miso soup was miso soup. Couldn't detect anything special about this one. Onto -DESSERT- and we had a few choices and both ended up with the berry layered cake. I believe they were going for a mille-crepe type of cake and it DID NOT work. I only had two bites as to not waste calories consuming blah foods. Go next door for dessert if you've got a huge sweet tooth! \n\nDebating between 3 and 4 stars, but rounding up! All the raw fish were great, but their cooked items and sushi rice need some work. Also, the pace between items could've been better. A few times we were left waiting for too long while other times the next course came much too quick. Will I be back? Heck yes and I'm hoping the pacing, rice, and fish bones carelessly left in my fish were a fluke. The quality of the raw items were outstanding and deserves another go :D","useful":39,"funny":35,"cool":39}

The chefs are all Japanese as are all of the women staff who dote on you discreetly throughout the meal. Every piece of fish that we had was of superior quality and I felt like the chef was specifically hand choosing each selection just for us. The dinner was expensive but truly worth it. Kudos to Nelson Q. whose review of Kabuto convinced me to take my wife here for her birthday dinner.\n\nI will mention one caveat which is crucial to getting seated for your reservation on time. They are located in a very crowded strip mall which contains many small restaurants and very limited parking. So if you want to make your 6:00 or 8:30 single seating reservation allow at least 15 - 20 minutes to find parking in the surrounding streets as the parking lot is always full.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Was it the best I've ever had? Naahh. The best I've had up to date is still Sushi Zo in Los Angeles.\n\nSimple and minimalist, Kabuto specializes in nigiri\/edomae sushi. Don't come here expecting to order some baked scallop, tiger dragon roll. Sushi-mon is a few miles away for that kind of stuff. (Same owners btw!) Seating is very limited as the entire restaurant is just one sushi bar counter and 3-4 tables so make your reservations in advance.\n\nKabuto offers three omakase options at $48, $80, and $120, and you can even order nigiri sushi by the piece. A few a la carte items are also available on their limited menu. \nMy wife and I opted for the $48 omakase which includes aperitif sake, amuse, 10 pieces of nigiri, a handroll, and dessert. We ended up spending about $200 for the two of us adding a glass of wine, an order of the 5 star sashimi, and a few additional pieces of nigiri. I will highlight some of the items: \n\nAperitif sake- Homemade fuji (imported from Japan) apple sake, and it was a great way to start the meal. Light (2% alcohol) yet invigorating. Really good!\n\nAmuse- mozuku topped with aoyagi (orange clam), aori-ika (king squid), and Japanese okra. This dish was super light and cleansing to the palate. The aori-ika had amazing texture. Ika is normally really chewy, but the aori-ika was so soft. It melted in my mouth! Amazing. \n\n5 star sashimi- more along the lines of 4 star sashimi. Included blue fin tuna, halibut, king squid, scallop, and spanish mackerel. The king squid was really good once again, and the scallop was really tender and flavorful with hints of yuzu. Spanish mackerel was dry. \n\nMa-aji nigiri (jack mackerel)- topped with citrus soy sauce and grated scallions. Very tasty with medium oily texture. The scallions really brought out the sweetness in this fish. \n\nAkami nigiri (blue fin tuna) from Spain- robust, rich in flavor, like a rare steak, drizzled in their house made soy sauce. I really enjoyed this blue fin nigiri. \n\nChu toro (medium fatty tuna) nigiri- sooo good. Creamy, soft, melted in the mouth. \n\nEzo-bafun uni- sweet Japanese sea urchin. The best uni I've ever tasted! It was soooo sweet and also really creamy. \n\nIkura (salmon roe)- served sashimi style, without rice nor seaweed. Sweet and savory with a little bit of spice from the wasabi. I could eat these eggs for breakfast every day!\n\nFukko (baby Japanese seabass)- a bit chewy and firm but retained a nice sweet flavor. \n\nToro handroll- this was the last item before the dessert. The combination of the warm sushi rice, seaweed, and toro was just mmmm orgasmic. Definitely one of the stars of the night. \n\nFor dessert, we concluded with a green tea roll cake and raspberry sorbet. The roll cake was really soft and moist, not too sweet, and the raspberry sorbet was super refreshing. The dessert was definitely the cherry on top to an excellent meal. Service was flawless as you would expect from a fine-dining sushi joint like this. The waitresses stuck to us like white on rice. Our drinks were never empty, and our plates were constantly being bussed one after another.\n\nVegas is saturated with ayce sushi joints, and after eating at several of them, they all start tasting the same. For those who prefer quality over quantity or want to experience sushi at some of its finest, Kabuto is the spot you are looking for.","useful":14,"funny":6,"cool":11}

We had several vendor dinners lined up for the week but we were on our own this night and I was really hoping to find something that wouldn't be too touristy or too heavy.  Between Yelp and Chowhound I decided this was the place to try. \n\nI made a reservation for the 8:30 seating at the sushi bar. The lady on the phone was very cute - she asked if I'd ever been there before and when I said no, she said \"I have to let you know that we are a fine sushi restaurant and don't have steak or chicken or sushi rolls.\"  Hehe.  I guess they get a lot of people who want some chicken fried rice and a California Roll and who pitch a fit when they can't get it?  Anyway, I assured her it was fine, that we wanted sushi, sushi, sushi.\n\nWe opted for the large omakase option ($120) and I honestly can't remember everything (maybe due to the 24 oz bottle of sake we split?) but I can tell you that the salmon roe and the blue fin tuna were my favorites. There was an amuse with monk fish liver that was also enough to make me weep.  The \"grill\" course was fine - eel, seared tuna and a couple of other things, but I would have preferred more nigiri.  \n\nI make it to Vegas every couple of years, sometimes more often.

I will start off by saying I am NOT a huge sushi fan. Crazy, I know. And I especially would not go to an omakase restaurant if I DID want sushi (cause I know I wouldn't like half the items on the menu). But since the boyfriend is a HUGE, wants-to-be-a-sushi-chef-in-the-future sushi lover, I have taken him to a $200\/person omakase experience before. \n\nAnd this is BETTER. For $48\/person. CRAZIER. \n\nI was reluctant the first time I came here, but the boyfriend made reservations for us when we made a solo trip to Vegas. It is off the strip so we drove here (15-20 minutes away). We chose the most basic omakase which is the $48 per person Nigiri course. The others are similar but also include cooked food which we didn't want. \n\nI can't remember every piece of fish that was served (but I'll include menus\/photos from both times I was there) but I enjoyed EVERY single one of them. They start you off with a strawberry sake which is amazing with an appetizer shortly after. The second time we got served monkfish liver which was soooo buttery and delicious (and I normally do not like sake or liver that much). And at the very end before dessert (green tea ice cream with red bean or a sorbet), they serve you a hand roll. \n\nThose HAND ROLLS. The first time I literally ordered three more. They are THAT good. The seaweed is so crunchy. The rice is PERFECT (and we all know that rice is the most important part!!). Need I say more? \n\nIn the end we spent about $120-150 for the both of us. The second time we went with another couple and they handed them the receipt for all four of us. They legit thought that the $300 bill was just for the two of them since they're so used to the omakase prices in SF, lol. \n\nHighly highly recommend.

The quality of the fish is mindblowing, it is undoubtedly better than Nobu or any other high end strip casino's overpriced sushi restaurant and far better priced, you'll probably spend 50-75% at Kabuto compared to any other strip joint.\n\nMy friends who are also sushi aficionados and I considered the omakase momentarily but ultimately we knew what to do:  we ordered one piece of every item on the menu.  The outstanding highlights fish wise were absolutely the toro (when I was there, they had three varieties ranging in fattiness) and the bonito, but nearly every piece of fish I ate was better than any other serving I have had of it at another restaurant anywhere in the USA, and I'm from Seattle, eat a ton of sushi, and have been to Japan 3 times.  The salmon roe was the best item and was mindblowingly better than any other I have had, my friends and I were absolutely dumbfounded.  We wound up spending about $125 apiece, and eating 22 pieces of nigiri each as well as sharing the two different kinds of miso they offered between the three of us, and a super popular roll we saw consistently ordered that night which turned out to not be that impressive compared to the rest. \n\nCertainly remember to make a reservation in advance, this place only seats 18, and if you are nuts about sushi you cannot miss this place.

What an experience.  The problem is, my wife and I can put down some sushi.  If you are looking for something like that, it will cost you a lot of money.  It's location is even mysterious.  It's located in the same shopping mall as Monta and Big Wongs.  No sign on the door, just located next to the Massage parlor.  On to the meal.  The fish was fresh and amazing.  We ate it traditional style, with hands and no chopsticks.  They bring you a little \"wet nap\" in a saki shot glass to clean after each tasting.  The sushi is served traditional style, with nothing refrigerated and served fresh daily.  We started with a flavored saki (plum wine i think?) to clean the palate.  Each piece was a work of art.  It is a great event and time to eat at Kabuto.  Closest thing in Las Vegas that we can get to Jiro's sushi.

This is unlike any other sushi spot in town (with the exception of the newly opened Yui). If you're going with someone not familiar with the concept, it's best to explain it to them and manage expectations. You don't want to bring someone expecting crazy Americanized rolls slathered in mayo and other sauces. Sit at the bar. That should be the only way to experience a place like this.\n\nThere are 3 levels of omakase menus available. I got the $80 yoroi while my wife got the $48 nigiri option along with an a la carte purchase of a sashimi platter. Everything was excellent. The sashimi was flawless, particularly the bluefin tuna and the oyster with spicy radish and ponzu. The same can be said about the grilled plate. I'm typically not a big fan of mackerel, but their grilled version topped with a somewhat sweet sauce instantly turned me into a fan.\n\nThe only real flaw is that the nigiri course moved at a lightning fast pace. I barely had time to enjoy each piece before the next arrived.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't for everyone. It's not a fun environment where you can kick back and relax. It's more like a shrine to the food. Or more like an art gallery where you have to pay homage to the works of art in near silence. But the food proves worthy of the setting as it's beauty and precision is something to behold.","useful":10,"funny":2,"cool":5}

When the miso soup came, it was smoky, earthy, salty, dotted with these tiny, perfect mushrooms, and absolutely delish.  And then the show really started. An appetizer of fluke wrapped around sprouts. Delicate, amazing texture, and the ideal shot across the bow.\n\nA procession of gorgeous fish followed, and darn me for not taking notes. There was more fluke, chu-toro, sea eel, a vibrant sea trout, jack mackerel, squid, three others that escape me and yummy yummy tamago. I ordered giant clam just for fun.

Rice had a nice consistency and the temperature was just right. Size of fish was on the small side. Besides that, I was very satisfied.

They pride themselves on traditional edomae-sushi (i.e. Tokyo style, where they apply the perfect amount of sauce and wasabi for you).   Fish is extremely fresh and flown in daily from Japan, Southern California (uni), and Boston (scallops).  They have a good assortment of premium fish, and the itamae is very skilled with the knife.  The restaurant is hard as bones to locate, but that's part of the appeal.  I'd say the clientele was 75% Japanese.  It's definitely high end but not overly so for Las Vegas.\n\nThis is an omakase (chef's choice) sushi restaurant, and that makes it even better. I went with the Kabuto omakase, and here's a high-level run down of the delicacies:\n\n- Palette cleanser -- chef's homemade sake\/sorbet!  Perfect, if surprisingly ight beginning\n\n- 5 pieces of shellfish sashimi -- highlight here was the tako, deliciously tender and they included the sucker.  Presentation was in a clam shell they had just opened\n\n- 5 pieces of sashimi -- exotic fishes from Japan.  Two different types of medium-fatty tuna one from the belly and one near the fin that began with a K and was my favorite piece of the night (they took note of that later!)\n\n- Grilled plate -- fantastic seared pieces of sushi, including kobe beef.  I usually sigh in disappointment during the \"cooked\" portion of an omakase but this was perfect and not too heavy\n\n- Sushi course -- they serve edomae style so one piece at at time.  This is especially important since they use warm rice.  I tried every piece of fish left on the menu!  Pacing was especially well done and the chefs provided the right amount of information without going overboard (no pun intended!)\n\n- Miso soup -- there are two choices, bone in fish or mushroom.  I went with the mushroom and it was some of the most delicious I have ever had.  I like ending with miso soup; this was a good sign we're talking classic omakase\n\n-  Dessert course -- a number of options, all handmade by their \"Japanese pasty chef\".  Strawberry mil crepes and of course mochi ice cream were tempting, but I went with the apple sorbet which they topped with a touch of gold leaf.  This was refreshing and light and thus didn't make me feel too gluttonous\n\nThe itamame seems to be a good guy and he cracked some jokes with the audience.  The restaurant is extremely clean and has a zen vibe to it.  This is the perfect type of omakase for me, but if you're more of a Sushi of Gari (i.e., lots of sauces, more fusion, more cooked dishes), you might get bored.  Presentation of some of the sashimi plates could have been more artful.  My glasses were refilled adequately but a touch slow.  Otherwise, best Japanese dining experience, EASILY, in Las Vegas if not in the whole Southwest to be frank.  The mainstay is the sushi bar, but it's not overly stuck up in the sense they have tables and even a booster seat for kids.","useful":10,"funny":1,"cool":4}

While it is not your traditional Sushi restaurant and nothing like an AYCE place in terms of value\/food, it more than makes up for this with a quality experience and top notch food.\n\nI'm not an expert at sushi, but this is the best I've had so far. And while the Edomae style of having the fish marinated in soy sauce may have compromised some uniqueness in flavor, the fish carries a texture that is nothing short of luxurious. Some pieces melt in your mouth, while some have some light resistance, but the fact that they can serve the items at room temperature makes it so they are more buttery than your average sushi joint.\n\nFor a first timer, I would certainly recommend sitting at the bar. Being able to watch these experts in motion and seeing how much time and effort is put into each portion of the meal is a treat. Receiving each piece of fish one by one paces out your meal in an enjoyable way.\n\nA panda and I decided to opt for the nigiri option - $48 dollars for a small sake aperitif, amuse, 10 nigiri, a hand roll and a dessert. While still quite pricey, it is a good value especially for a first timer being able to sample a lot of different fish that I would normally have never tried. One thing that's great about Edo style is that you do not get a \"fishy\" smell or after taste - but some people certainly might miss that.\n\nOur favorite of the night was the chu-toro, though the normal akami and many of the others were very good. \n\nIf there was one thing to nitpick, the green tea tiramisu that evening was rather bland. The texture was amazing but there was a lack of sweetness as well as a lack of green tea flavor. Additionally, the vanilla ice cream with sea salt was nothing to phone home about.\n\nStill, I would probably admit that the subtler flavor is common in Asian-style desserts, so I wasn't surprised either.\n\nI would highly recommend anyone who appreciates sushi to try Kabuto - I know there are similar restaurants in other cities but it was definitely a first for me, and an experience I won't soon forget.","useful":11,"funny":8,"cool":10}

A JAPANESE RESTAURANT THAT SERVES EDOMAE STYLE SUSHI!!!!!!\n\nNo, I'm not talking about krab, cream cheese, and yum-yum sauced creations better known as Western Style sushi, but the traditional authentic style sushi you would find in Japan. Thanks yet again to Takashi Segawa, the President\/Owner of the Mon Restaurant Group (Sushi Mon on Maryland Parkway,Monta Ramen, and Goyemon), locals and visitors can finally experience Kabuto which has been in the works for the past three years.\n\nI immediately phoned in after finding info through the Yelp App to see if they had any openings, and WHADDAYAKNOW??? There was an opening at 6pm at the bar! Must be my lucky day!?!?!?! I get there promptly at 6pm, and give the waitress my name, and a guy at the bar says \"Nelson?\" \"Yes\", I reply and I assume and guess wrongly that he was Alex S.(Yelp Las Vegas' Authority on Japanese Cuisine) and it was none other than Yelp Las Vegas' resident jokester, Hootie B. So we \"talk story\" a bit in anticipation of our dinner, about the Vegas food scene, and how we were both excited to see the slow transformation of Vegas' \"Japantown\", and to tell you the truth, Hootie's good people.....\n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance is somewhat minimalist in a good way...you won't find TV's with the game going on, or top 40 music blasting through the speakers, etc. the staff at Kabuto really pride themselves on tradition here, and that is evident in the beautiful cypress wood countertop\/bar without your typical refrigerated showcase, the necessary tools, dishes and ingredients needed to execute such perfection.\n\nOnly the best available fish and seafood are served here. Absolutely no frozen fish whatsoever, and Ingredients are delivered direct from the world's best regions. As far as the menu selections go, you may order a la carte, do the Nigiri Tasting ($48)\nand in the future, a chef's \"Omakase\" ($80). At the time, the Omakase wasn't available since it was a \"Soft Opening\" for friends and family, so I went with the Nigiri Dinner.\n\nI also got one of the best seats in the place, directly in front of the sushi chef which was where all the action took place.\n\nAfter checking with my server of any possible allergies and sushi preferences,\nI clean my hands with the hot towel that is provided, and a black plate(Slate!?!?)\nis placed on the ledge in front of me where I will recieve my nigiri one by one.\nDO NOT PLACE THIS IN FRONT OF YOU...IT IS TO REMAIN THERE THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE MEAL...THIS IS THE WAY IT IS TRADITIONALLY DONE.\n\nMy dinner begins with a PINEAPPLE SAKE APPERITIF. Aged for 100 days in house, this went down smoothly and warmed my body. the chef also informed me that they will be rotating flavors in the future.I'm not a big sake fan, but this was delicious! My appetizer was SEA SNAIL AND GEODUCK CLAM WITH CUCUMBER, RADISH, ENOKI, AND MISO DRESSING. The sweetness and crunch of the sea snail and clam paired well with the dressing and fresh vegetables.\n\nMy 10 pieces of excellence were SUZUKI, GIANT CLAM, BABY AMBERJACK, CHERRY SALMON, TORO,SNAPPER, IKURA, OPAL EYE, OH-TORO, AND ANAGO.\nThe chef will decide what type of nigiri he thinks you will enjoy. If you read the other reviews, no one recieved the same exact thing. The Chef also adds fresh wasabi to each piece of nigiri and brushes 3-year aged shoyu or the accompanying sauce on each piece, tells you what it is and where it comes from and sets it on your plate. At this point, you are to consume each piece entirely(not multiple bites) while the rice is still at body temperature either by using chopsticks or your hands. A cool looking wooden cup with a wet towel will be provided for those using their hands. The ginger is not to be passed up either. It is crisp, sweet and has a nice heat to it(I'm assuming it is made in house as well) and was a great palate cleanser between each nigiri and digestive aid as well.\n\nAfter the 10 piece chef's choice, he will offer you more nigiri or a handroll. I chose a handroll and the chef made one with TORO. I also added MISO SOUP which was also chef recommended. Using both red and white miso, this came with a piece of bone-in fish that the server called a \"rare deep sea fish.\" Great flavor and very tasty...\n\nDessert choices that are all made in house were Mango Sorbet, Chocolate Mousse, Layered Crepes with Strawberry Sauce and the highly suggested MOCHI ICE CREAM.\nThe green tea, vanilla, and peanut butter mochi were a great ending to an exceptional meal.\n\nRemember, you will never find any cream cheese stuffed, mayo baked, or yum-yum laced creations here...if you're a \"roll\" person and not big on nigiri or have no clue what it is, Kabuto is not for you...ALOHA!!! \n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(225\/365) \"  My Excellent Edomae Experience\"","useful":40,"funny":17,"cool":32}

It was first day restaurant got alcohol license and started to serve sake. We all ordered $48 Nigiri tasting meal. It started with one shot of house pineapple sake to clean up your palate, and I got monk fish liver with okura as appetizer. Then it came with 10 courses of nigiri sushi - medium fatty tuna (chu toro), shad, jack mackerel, spring baby tai snapper, salmon roe, cherry salmon, bonito, squid, eggs (tamago), and ended with chu toro handroll.(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/wWuGa3OOQJro_XGe-GKBXA?select=MR9S-geJqi2dw4DLKpAukw#8ucngOoyjJNGFLhSahQjDg)\nAll the fish tasted soooo fresh and elegant. Nigiri was prepared perfectly with right portion of wasabi and aged soy sauce. I was told by chef most of fish were flown in daily from Japan. Blue fin tuna was flown from Spain. Claims were from east coast. And lived ama ebi (sweet shrimps) were from Santa Barbara. Everything here tasted very authentic. There was no yum yum sauce, AYCE, sushi lasania and blahhhh... It's a true edomae style sushi place for true foodies. I was seated at sushi bar. Both sushi chefs were very friendly and humorous. My mom had a good time to practice her broken Japanese (took 3 years Japanese classes in college) with them. I enjoyed the show chef put it in front of me. It really made me appreciate the sushi that was presented on my plate. I also ordered lived ama ebi on top of my tasting meal. It was the biggest ama ebi I ever had. I couldn't stop smiling after I had it. Nigiri tasting meal ends with complimentary desert. I had \"layered crepe\" with strawberry cream \"cake\". I really enjoyed the texture of layered crepe. I also tried their homemade mochi and chocolate muse. I would say strawberry crepe was the best out of three. \n\nI felt very fortunate that we finally got a REAL EDOMAE STYLE SUSHI RESUAURANT in Vegas. Right after my meal, I tried to make another reservation with host on mother's day (1 week after). But I was told restaurant is closed every Sunday. (only day without fresh fish delivery) So I had to change to some other days. I can't wait to come back to try their omakase.

Too bad it disappointed me. The restaurant was clearly trying to get rid of an excess of blue fin tuna from Spain. We both got the $80 pp omakase. The first course was great - fuji apple 2% sake made in-house. The 2nd course was extremely disappointing - it was blue fin tuna marinated in soy sauce but it was incredibly fishy and tasted odd. Next came the 3rd course which had 4 pieces of sashimi. Guess what was in it? Blue fin tuna from Spain (this time I think it was a fresher piece), clam (my favorite of them), a white fish from Japan, and Oyster from Seattle. Next 4th course consisted of three pieces: kobe beef wrapping radish topped with ponzu radish, cod grilled with sesame sauce, and blue fin tuna from Spain grilled. I took one bite of the tuna and was so disgusted I couldn't finish it - it was incredibly fishy. When the 5th course came, I was happier to see the ikura rice, uni, mackerel, yellowtail, and yet another blue fin tuna. Everything was alright - it wasn't the best sushi I've had. 6th course: blue fin tuna, halibut, and tamago. The best was the tamago here. Finally came the hand roll which was supposed to have toro - wished they put more green onions in here. The green tea red bean cake was good but the raspberry sorbet was too sweet for my taste. In summary, my favorites included: apple sake, clam, tamago, and green tea red bean cake. I think what bothered me and my bf the most about this place was the temperature of the fish. It was warmer than what we are used to\/feel should be the right temperature for nigiri. I'll say the rice is pretty good here. Just hoping it was an off night or if the heat got to the kitchen. Even the dining area was incredibly warm and uncomfortable. Our server was very nice though. Not sure I'd say this is a must try if you're in Vegas.

The decor is gorgeous and the pale blonde wood bar and interior decoration serves as a stark contrast to the strip mall outside. Don't be fooled by appearances from the outside - when you step into Kabuto, you completely forget the fact that you're in Las Vegas. Like any great sushi chef, Gen-san keeps his restaurant, work surfaces, and knives spotlessly clean. The ambience really adds to the enjoyment of the meal. As other reviews have mentioned, try to get a seat early to avoid the fish running out, and I would also add that getting a seat at the bar instead of a table is a must.\n\nNow - on to the sushi!\n\nWe ordered the $50 omakase nigiri - figuring that the best thing to get at an Edomae sushi restaurant would be the sushi. Next time, I may opt for the expanded omakase course, but I certainly don't think you can go wrong with ordering the nigiri omakase course. We also supplemented the course with a number of ala-carte nigiri orders, to try and enjoy more of what they had to offer that night. \n\nSome highlights from the meal:\n\n1. Cherry sake apertif - house made, with only 2% alcohol content. Very refreshing and a nice palate cleanser.\n\n2. Hirame - very fresh, with an incredible snappy texture to the fish. Clean flavors were a great start to the meal. The first thing I noticed was that the rice was notably warmer than I was used to, but also unfailingly delicious. Gen-san really knows his rice!\n\n3. Chu-toro - probably my favorite piece of fish the entire meal. It had both flavor and melt-in-your mouth fattiness. Not much to say about it, but I think after having had it that I understand why it's the sushi chef's cut of choice.\n\n4. Ikura (served in glassware) - this was mindblowing. The small spheres of salmon roe were distinct - not sticky and overly salty like you would find at inferior places. I generally dislike ikura but I couldn't get enough of this. The roe had a subtle lingering sweet taste in addition to that first hit of brininess.\n\n5. Uni - also very high quality. Creamy and cool with the taste of the sea, this was a great example of uni.\n\n6. Botan ebi - super fresh (it was alive until they served it to us). It had none of the fishiness and stickiness that I've come to associate with raw shrimp. The texture was appropriately springy, and it was perfectly seasoned.\n\n9. Kamashita - the section of the tuna under the collar, the fattiness on this piece was ridiculous. The color was a rosy pink with a fine webbing of white fat throughout the fish. It was obvious as soon as we saw it that this was not your ordinary piece of tuna. Truly melt-in-your-mouth.\n\n7. O-toro - many people would call bluefin o-toro the king of sushi, but I think it played second fiddle both to the Kamashita and the chu-toro. Then again, it could be that my palate was simply a bit tired of tuna at that point, but it simply didn't taste as good as the other tuna we had, despite the fact that it was suitably fatty and well-marbled.\n\n8. Toro hand roll - the highlight of the hand roll was not the fish, but the rice and the seaweed. The nori was beautifully crisp, flavorful, and I honestly wish that I had bags of it to take home with me to snack on.\n\nKabuto was rated one of Bon Appetit's top 50 new restaurants in 2012, and it's easy to see why. The food is astounding, given that they've only been in business for a year or so, and I can easily see it getting better. I wouldn't be surprised to see it gain a Michelin star or two over the next few years. Gen-san and his staff were gracious hosts, and made me feel extremely welcome at the restaurant. His love and dedication to sushi really shows, and I'll make it a point to visit here every time I'm in Las Vegas from here on out.","useful":10,"funny":1,"cool":3}

Of course when you think of sushi in Las Vegas I was a bit skeptical considering that they're nowhere near any port to get the freshest of seafoods. But I was pleasantly surprised by what they had to offer. They have ala carte and omakase selections. The menu changes daily based on what seafoods are available for freshness. \n\nI went with the Yoroi, which is the mid-tier omakase selection. In it, you'll get a cup of sake, which on this night that I went, made fresh in the store. Yes you heard me, they made it at Kabuto, not the bottled stuff. It was a Yuzu flavored sake which they took 8 months to age. Very smooth and tasty. The Yoroi also gives you a sashimi platter, 3 grilled dishes, 8 pieces of nigiri, one handroll of negitoro, miso soup and dessert.\n\nFor the value ($80), it was a tasty treat. They're very creative in their presentation and flavors. For example, one of the grilled dishes I had was grilled scallop topped with an uni flavored butter sauce. Yum.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit away from the strip and downtown but parking is available or any of those ride-shares and taxis can get you there. They are very thoughtful and will offer to call you a cab after dinner as well. The service is very friendly and you can't beat a restaurant in America where everyone in the front of the house including the sushi chefs are all Japanese and from Japan for an authentic experience. Highly recommend a visit here. Just wish that the pieces were a little bigger like what you would get from an omakase in Japan or Hawaii. But seeing that they aren't in an area where fresh seafood is readily available, I understand why the pieces may be just a tad smaller. There's no drop out though as far as taste and satisfaction. Any average sushi eater will be satisfied. I've just been spoiled with eating omakase's in Japan and Hawaii.","useful":8,"funny":5,"cool":3}

We were given a slate that is kept in between you and the chef the entire time so he can serve you one piece at a time and also served with just the right amount of wasabi and soy sauce made by them, and I really liked the warm rice. By this time we had finished the wine and started on Sake, so my picture taking was forgotten and a little shotty. In no particular order:\n\no-toro\nchu-toro\nakami\nchikamekintoki\nmejina\nhoubou\nma-saba\nhandroll\nikura \nMiso soup with shrimp head\nand gyoku\n\nOur server Naomi was so informative, explaining each fish and the region it came from, she had also made a special request for me to the chef to let him know my favorite Japanese Mackerel was on the menu, and he made sure to make that apart of the Omakase. \n\nWe ended the meal with Green Tea Tiramisu and a Custard filled balloon dessert that was fun to pop, it came with a Swedish FIsh filled with caramel that you poured over the custard. Reminded me of Panna Cotta.\n\nThis is by far the best sushi I've had since Tsukiji Fish Market.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":4}

The restaurant was simply decorated and located in one of the worst parking plazas in all of Chinatown. Their omakase courses feature three different options in addition to a la carte. The most affordable is the nigiri for $48 featuring an aperitif sake, amuse, 10 course nigiri, hand roll, and dessert. The medium priced omakase for $80 has an additional 4 kinds of sashimi, 3 grill pieces, miso soup with 8 piece nigiri. The signature $120 kabuto omakase has an additional piece of sashimi, 5 piece grill platter, and 12 nigiri in addition to the above.\n\nOn this particular evening, we were celebrating a departing friend and opted to go for a nigiri and yoroi omakase course. We started off with the delightful aperitif sake which happened to be tangerine with 3% alcohol aged 6 months. Our amuse course consisted of a monk fish liver, served with various pickled vegetables. The sour flavors really perked up the senses of the tongue.\n\nFor the sashimi course, there was bonito with grated ginger and chives, oyster, baby Japanese sea bass with seaweed paste, and orange clam. Of the pieces, I really liked the sea bass with seaweed paste and the bonito. I wasn't a fan of the orange clam. The grilled platter consisted of braised blue fin tuna, blue crab, and seared ocean trout. I was amazed by how well done the blue fin was as I don't think I've ever had it cooked in such a way. The blue crab was light, and the ocean trout was just as good as the tuna. \n\nAs for the nigiri courses, we had ikura (salmon roe) spooned atop a small cup of rice (I love ikura with rice), sea urchin, akami (lean tuna), inada (young yellowtail), orange clam (again), and itoyori bream. The second set of nigiri had the omelette, chu-toro (medium fatty tuna), yellow grouper, mackerel, stripped pig. While I wasn't very impressed with the first set of nigiri, the second half was great, including my favorite chu-toro, and surprisingly un-fishy mackerel, and stripped pig. \n\nThe nigiri for the most part was good, but I didn't think any of the other chef's choices of akami (lean tuna), inada (young yellowtail), orange clam, or itoyori were anything special. I added on a jabara-toro (bellows belly bluefin tuna from Spain) for $9 and while it was tasty and fatty, was a bit disappointed by the stringy consistency and perhaps regretted not going for the premium silky fatty tuna for $1 more. The hand roll was toro from Tokyo with scallions. \n\nFor dessert, we each had our choice of either a cheesecake tart, mango sorbet, or green tea, and ended up getting one of each, all of which were quite tasty. The strawberry cheesecake tart was the best of the three and only available to the yoroi menu.\n\nOverall, the meal was good, but of course I didn't leave completely full. In contrast, you're also paying a lot less at different price points of $48, $80, and $120 for these omakase versus the more expensive $165. Was it worth it at it's price point? Perhaps, but there was no wow factor.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":4}

There is no doubt in my mind that Kabuto has the best fish quality of any sushi place I've tried in Las Vegas. Kabuto also has the most interesting selection of fish as far as authentic Japanese sushi of any sushi place I've tried in Las Vegas. And the decor of this place is just lovely - it's like being back in Japan. The bottom line is if I'm in Vegas and I want good authentic sushi, Kabuto is where I go. Gosh, I'm raving on and on about this place - so why four stars and not five?\n\nI try to review restaurants based on what the restaurants are. I'm not going to complain about how pricy a gourmet multi-course extravaganza at a  *** Michelin restaurant is, just as I'm not going to complain about the somewhat lacking service at a fast food joint or Strip tourist trap. This is where the problem with Kabuto lies;  they make themselves out to be an edomae sushi restaurant. When I judge them on that basis, that is where they lose one star.\n\nThe first problem is that when ordering one of the set menus, all the sushi is pre-sliced as soon as the order is placed. Then, each individual sushi is made and presented. This is a huge no-no for edomae style; the fish should only be sliced during the process of making each piece of sushi. Of course, this issue can be avoided by ordering a la carte - but nevertheless, it just shouldn't be what's done at an edomae sushi joint.\n\nThe second problem is the huge temperature control problem on the rice. This has been a problem on each of my many visits here; it's almost as if they don't even try to make the rice temperature consistent. When the rice is delivered from the kitchen, it is very warm, and of course that makes the sushi quite warm. After a while, it cools down, and then it better resembles \"normal\" sushi, but during a meal at Kabuto I will typically experience a whole gradient of temperatures - sometimes more than once. This absolutely should not happen; the rice temperature should be consistent. Anyone who has ever gone to an edomae place knows this. Heck, even anyone who has watched Jiro and never eaten sushi before knows this.\n\nAnd to be clear, this is not a warm rice vs room temp rice issue. (I actually have never had a warm rice edomae experience, not even in the dozens of edomae place I've tried in Japan, but I once read an article suggesting that as many as 10% of Japanese edomae sushi chefs subscribe to the warm rice practice. But again, that's not the issue, since the problem at Kabuto is that the rice temp varies considerably.)\n\nAnyway - if you love sushi, you will probably enjoy Kabuto, so go and enjoy it. Just be aware of these shortcomings as far as Kabuto's execution, which IMO definitely warrant a one-star deduction.","useful":10,"funny":4,"cool":3}

Kabuto doesn't find it necessary to dress up their space in the absence of its service or quality. They leave it up to the food to do the talking.\n\nWith only two seatings offered at night, it is imperative to make reservations in advance. Three omakase courses are offered, ranging from $48-$120. We opted for the happy medium and went with the Yoroi ($80). If you are okay with trying a few items that are not sushi, then this may be your best option. In hindsight, the Nigiri course would be my preferred option. It weeds out all the cooked items and focuses solely on the fish.\n\nRaspberry Sake -- I was somewhat hesitant in consuming the shot of sake but our waitress assured us that the alcohol content was very light. I was pleasantly surprised as it tasted almost like Raspberry juice. It was a fresh way to start off the meal with something so light and crisp.\n\nHokkaido Hotate Nigiri -- Kabuto hands down is the best in the game. It was so good I had to order it again. The texture was so soft that you could tell right off the bat how fresh it was. The modest brush of shoyu intensified the sweetness. It was incredibly amazing. \n\nSeared Fatty Tuna -- Would've loved to taste the fatty tuna without the modification but I can't complain. It was so rich and creamy, it was as if the fat was seeping through my gums into my veins. \n\nIkura -- I will preface this by saying salmon roe is not my cup of tea. I had high hopes that I would not hear that word at all during the meal but when I saw the cup of Salmon eggs coming my way, I held my breathe. It was unusually salty, the bed of sweet rice could not save it.\n\nThere are only 3-4 tables in the restaurant and a handful of seats at the bar. With such limited seating, that gives your Itamae the time and TLC you can only wish every chef would give to you. Kabuto has delivered the most indelible experience, in terms of sushi in Sin City, and I cannot wait to return. Arigato!","useful":10,"funny":3,"cool":4}

Let me tell you it was totally worth the wait! Best sushi I've ever had (I've never been to Japan though). \nYou have 3 options to choose from: nigiri ($48), $80 which also includes grilled items and sashimi, and a $115 option which I didn't really even look at. All the dinners include a sake aperitif (ours was house made orange, served over ice, and so good), amuse (3 pieces of bluefin marinated in house sauce with fresh wasabi - delish), hand roll (more bluefin, still great), & dessert (i had the melon sorbet, hubs had the layered strawberry crepe. Both were good). My husband had the $80 meal, I had the $48 and we shared. The sashimi was all excellent, but I was totally blown away by the nigiri. Each bite we were literally saying, \"this is the best fish I've ever had!\" Even the rice was a cut above! I am usually not a fan of roe, but the dish we were served was actually good, and did not taste like the ocean! My only notes on the food are that it's kinda lame to serve the little omelet and about half the items were tuna. I love quality tuna, but they might have branched out a little more. The grill items were equally amazing (beef, rockfish, and ??). \n\nThe atmosphere is very austere. About 4 tables and a simple sushi bar for 10. I wouldn't recommend coming in a group larger than 2 because you won't get to sit at the sushi bar, where you watch your own personal sushi chef cut and prepare each item.  \nBetween our chef and two waitresses, service was excellent. \nDecent sake list with about 12 bottles, all served cold. \nThe price is very reasonable for the quality of fish you get. If you are looking for extremely fresh, simply prepared sushi, I would recommend Kabuto to anyone.

Ever since i saw the episode of Anthony Bourdain - No\nReservations - http:\/\/youtu.be\/yuhu4QZJZyw i knew i had to tried this.  \n\nNothing crazy here.  Just some old fashion, traditional sushi ,and darn good if you ask me.   Bonito, Jack Mackerel, Uni with Ikura, and Cherry Salmon to name a few off the Nigiri Omakase. Finish off with a Tamago that taste like pancake and a Negi-toro hand roll.  Of course the Itamae (skilled chef) will ask if you would like to order anything else ala carte before you get to those. Nigiri Omakase is the way to go.  Just let them know if you have any preference or allergies before hand.\n\nAvoid the tables at all cost.  Even if you have to sacrifice some friends.  Cast them off, tell them lies, do whatever it takes to diminish the group size.  I made a mistake the first time i came around because i joined a party of 4 at the table. Good company ;however, i've missed out on the show.  The last couple time I was fortunate enough to sit at the bar, granted I called 30min prior to closing if they would take in one more resv.   Yea, I'm THAT guy.\n\nTiming is a somewhat crucial. The server informed me that sushi taste different when served from Itamae directly as opposed to table service because of amount of time the fish and rice are exposed to the air temperature.   It's highly recommended that you eat when you are served.  Like straight off the chef's hands if possible.  \n\nCalling in for a reservation? How about call in and reserve fresh fishy? Yup, they take special request like that too, but i would imagine you have to be with in the \"in\" crowd to be able to call dibs on those prized catch.  Not to worry though, fishes are flown in daily so there's always going to be something for everyone.\n\nNow that they just got their liquor license, i'm not certain if you can still BYOB.

Perhaps you lived or visited Japan and have been to sushi-yas all over North America searching for that one special place to replicate it. \n\nA place not only offering quality fish, but also caring service on the standard you are accustomed to in Japanese restaurants, fresh, seasonal ingredients prepared in a thoughtful manner, excellent rice selection and knowledgable staff. Kabuto has this in spades. \n\nThis restaurant is exquisite, and so good my partner and I made a reservation to eat there again during a recent Vegas trip before we had even finished our first meal there. We cancelled a third visit to Guy Savoy to eat here again. It really is that good. (Although in a completely different class than G.S., to be fair) \n\nLike many other Yelpers, would recommend the nigiri course and then ordering by the piece until you are sated. We got the yoroi course the first time, and although it is good and showcases many things the kitchen does well, I felt I wanted more focus on nigiri sushi and we opted for more piece by piece ordering on our second visit. There is enough variety on their daily fish menu to please the most well versed sushi aficionado ... or even the most novice. Saw a few fish on the two visits that were new to me, but also many classics. \n\nThe fish is immaculate and varied, as mentioned. But the rice - God, the rice. Fluffy, a little warm, just a little sweet sour with seasoning, this is perfect shari. Any place that cares about fish will care even more about the rice, and they do at Kabuto. Feel free to ask about the fish, though - they will tell you down to the island where it was caught if you are curious. \n\nAnd without getting political, for the health of our oceans, I would recommend you steer away from bluefin. Yes, it's delicious, and yes Kabuto offers it, but it's also horribly overfished and there are many other fish that are not as over harvested and just as, if not more delicious. Go out on a limb a bit, and give bluefin tuna a break!","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":1}

I had to ask at Monta since I knew they were owned by the same. Sushimon and Goyemon too are part of the same group.\n\nKabuto is good. It is small. It does the upscale sushi -- like many places in NY -- but that it is in Las Vegas is GREAT. I went alone late at night and sat at the sushi bar. A cricket was jumping around on my table and the chef tried to shoo it away. It was a bit funny.\n\nI had chirasi, miso, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri sushi. I didn't get the set menus. The chirasi is delicious - loved the rice underneath it, but it is very small... more like an appetizer course. The yellow tail, tuna, uni, and a few other fish I can't name -- ordered at the wait staff's suggestion. They were thinly sliced, was fresh etc. \n\nThe wasabi was FRESH - this was what was great for me. I get lots of fresh fish at lots of sushi restaurants in Las Vegas... but not many have fresh wasabi. On the other hand, I really enjoy eating at Goyemon for 1\/3 of the price. I think my bill came to about $75 for one person not including tip. I wanted to try it and I'm glad I did... \n\nIt's either that more and more sushi restaurants are getting better or I'm not as finicky as before. I've eaten at sushi restaurants all over Japan, Korea, US - NY, SF, LA... and I think my request is pretty simple... give me fresh yellowtail sashimi and that just about does it for me along with uni. Sen of Japan is I think equal to Kabuto... and I really enjoy Sen. But if I were to go eat sushi alone again... I may just head on out to Goyemon and eat at the sushi bar. It doesn't have the ambiance, or the artisan flair, but their yellow tail is just as good.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When I say authentic, I am also referring to the chefs and servers. It is located in a strip mall in Chinatown and is somewhat unnoticeable if you're not looking for it. The restaurant itself offers a very intimidate experience, only providing seats for up to 20 guests and 8 of those seats are at the sushi bar. What you'll encounter here is a very formal Japanese way of eating sushi in which the chef will choose your dish and prepare in front of you and deliver it directly to you. \n\nUpon arrival, my boyfriend and I were seated amongst the sushi chefs and might I add, it was a little intimidating at first for some odd reason to have them all staring at you. We were greeted by extremely friendly servers whom brought hot towels. Afterwards, we were given a house made aperitif in a shot glass, peach to be exact, that was 2% alcohol and extremely refreshing. There are 3 different options in which you can choose from, aside from ordering a la carte. Depending on your appetite and what you want to taste depends on the option you chose. We decided to go with the $80\/pp option which gave us an amuse, nigiri (8 pieces), sashimi (4 pieces), grilled items (3 varieties), hand roll, miso soup and dessert. \n\nOf our meal, I remember the following:\n-Amuse that consisted of fish intestine\n-Sashimi: bluefin tuna, clam, octopus\n-Nigiri: salmon roe, uni, o-toro, chu-toro, mackerel \n\nI personally didn't want to ruin the one-on-one experience we had with our sushi chef so I didn't take any pictures, the pictures provided was from my bf and as you can tell he wasn't able to capture everything.  All I can say is, this is seriously the most top-notch sushi and sashimi (flown in from different countries including Japan and Spain) that you will ever consume in all of Vegas and I've had sushi at many different locations, on and off the strip. Keep in mind that you CANNOT be a picky eater and have to be very open minded when dining here, as it is best experienced omakase style - when the chef chooses your meal.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They make your sushi one by one and they already put the soy sauce on top. They have 3 levels of omakase, $48, $80, and $120. I've gotten the $80 and the $48 one. If you like cooked fish, get the $80 omakase. They give you plenty of food, cooked and raw. If you just want to eat nigiri sushi, get the $48. I usually get the $48 omakase and add-on 3-4 pieces of the \"premium\" sushi afterwards. This will make me pretty full by the end of the night and the bill usually comes out to about $75-80 + tax and tip per person. \nMy hubby and I also recently went to Japan to eat. The sushi here is pretty comparable to the 2 michelin-star sushi restaurant we ate at over there (Sushi Kanesaka--they win slightly because their rice is so damn good).\nAnyways, overall this is a very delicious, authentic sushi restaurant and worth the drive from So CA to Vegas at least once a year.

Plus the ramen place Monta, apparently owned by the same people, was such a revelation for me. Kabuto and Monta are in the same Las Vegas strip mall. For me, Kabuto was a disappointment. It was above average sushi. With a beer, a 10-piece nigiri sampler, a couple of extra pieces of sushi and a tip, my bill came to $84. My taste buds didn't taste sushi that rated that kind of cost.\nTo cut directly to the point, two sushi stood out as especially fishy tasting: the jack mackerel and the shad. The jack mackerel had an especially strong sardine taste. I was eating the ginger after that one. I have to confess I'm not a veteran of high-end sushi places. Maybe this was how the jack mackerel and the shad was supposed to taste. If I'm spending a lot of money on the food (this sushi is flown in fresh daily, according to other online reviews) I'm expecting a superb experience.\nFor me, the unpleasant tasting sushi started with the first one. It's listed on the menu as kinme or golden big eye. I assume from a Google search it's some kind of snapper. It was a mild fishy taste. Not as strong as the jack mackerel or shad. But right from the start it was an unpleasant fish taste.\nThe sushi I liked the most were the fattier tunas plus the sweet shrimp. Both the medium fatty tuna, the chu-toro, and the premium fatty tuna, the o-toro, were delicious. The sweet shrimp and the o-toro were sushi I bought in addition to the 10-piece sampler. \nI started my meal with a mango sake that was pleasant and some sort of spicy radish. I couldn't quite understand how they were pronouncing its name. \nEven the sushi I liked didn't blow me away, though. Not enough to justify the price of a meal at Kabuto.\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful. There is no sign on the exterior, just a plain wall and a window. When you get inside, the restaurant is truly beautiful. Simple, elegant and tasteful are the words that come to mind.\nAnd the service was excellent. They came through there.\nAgain, I have to acknowledge I don't have experience at top sushi places. But I can go to places in the Bay Area that has sushi that tastes as fresh or better on my taste buds and it's a quarter of the price.","useful":7,"funny":4,"cool":2}

The way they prepare everything so methodically is a pleasure to watch. Everything we had was beyond anything you will have at most any sushi restaurant.

The second and third tier options are significantly more expensive.  And I'm here for the fish, not the cooked stuff.  If I wanted cooked Japanese, I would've went to Raku across the parking lot.

I was able to get reservations only at 8 PM, so we entered on time and were seated at the bar.  We ended up next to the GM and Lead Sommelier of Sensi, who knew both Misti Y. and Bobby Y. well, and when I got to work today, I learned my supervisor knows them as well!  It is a small world.\n\nI ordered sparkling rose and Eric R. the moscato d'asti - we were celebrating after all!  Also, iced green tea for me and hot green tea for him.  He opted for the nigiri set and I ordered the omakase.  We spoke with our bar-mates and the chefs about our upcoming trip to Japan.  It almost makes me nervous thinking about it!\n\nWe started with the pineapple sake apertif (made in house) - went down easy and very refreshing.  Appetizer: ankimo with wakame and cucumber.  Delicious.  Next, the chef asked if I wanted my sashimi and grill courses first, and then Eric R. and I could have sushi courses at the same time.  We agreed.  I shared my sashimi with Eric R. (tuna, cherry salmon, white snapper + daikon, wakame, seaweed noodles but not kelp - I asked).\n\nNext, grill course was grilled snapper tail, boiled mantis shrimp (purple shrimp that tasted almost like soft shell crab - amazing), and small clam sliced.  Then we began the sushi course.  We started with blue fin tuna, golden snapper, shad, king of squid, tamago, anago, and cherry salmon.  The confusion began here.  We had ordered our meals with one chef, but the other chef made the sushi course for us.  He mixed up who had nigiri set and who had omakase.  So I ended up eating Eric R.'s dinner for a time, and we realized it and felt embarrassed.  I definitely did not want to complain, but I did not want a hungry husband at the prices we paid.  We mentioned it to the chefs and Eric R. received his remaining pieces.  So they generously had given me extra nigiri on the house.\n\nWe had triangle (back of tuna, fatty), jack mackerel, ikura, uni, orange clam.  Then Eric R. ordered extra at that point: dharma snapper (because it was the last piece, it was on the house!), halfbeak (he had the last of that too haha), and black grouper, which was his favorite of those additions.  We forgot to get sweet shrimp until it was out as well.  Next, we each received negi toro handrolls.  Then I got a delicious miso soup with tiny mushrooms that had amazing flavor.  Eric R. asked for a bowl of sushi rice.  Lastly, dessert.  We ordered one strawberry layered crepe and the house made mochi, but since we don't like peanut butter we got 2 vanilla and 1 matcha.  After dessert, we received a different type of hot green tea to end the meal.\n\nOverall, it was a unique, 2 hour experience, a very calming and special one.  It is very different than high energy, large, fast-paced AYCE joints for sure.  Every cut of fish is fresh and special for the day.  When we were served nigiri, the chef told us the name and origin of the fish.  The real wasabi was WOW!  The service was a tad slow - it was very difficult to get our non-alcoholic drinks initially and I don't like to drink too much alcohol before eating, and it was very hard to track down a server and get refills on water and tea.  The kindness of the servers and the willingness of the chefs to answer our questions and to correct the mistake in who was eating what made it a very stellar experience.

Long story short, Kabuto is phenomenal. If you're looking for traditional Edomaezushi, look no further. You want the freshest of sushi neta flown in from various parts of the world each day? Do you dream of meticulously constructed nigiri with just the right amount of real wasabi and a brush of aged shoyu? Your search has ended.\n\nEvery aspect of Kabuto oozes excellence. The exterior is very unassuming and elegant in its simplicity. No gaudy signs. No sign at all, in fact. Just a small window strip display lets you know you've arrived at the right place. This simple elegance continues with the interior decor. Nothing seems out of place. Do yourself a favor and sit at the beautiful cypress sushi bar. This is where the magic happens.\n\nThe quality of product is only half the story at Kabuto. There is something truly captivating about watching a highly skilled Itamae (that's probably redundant) prepare these edible works of art. Do yourself another favor--eat the nigiri with your hands. This is something I learned a long time ago, but Kabuto is the first place that I truly felt like it was the only way to go.\n\nNow about this \"real sushi\" business, if I'm not mistaken, sushi refers to the vinegared rice. I hazard to say that the art of sushi has merely evolved. There is a place in this world for AYCE and unagi nigiri and Yum Yum Rolls. (Not that I've ever had a Yum Yum Roll, nor do I know what it even contains, but I like the fact that it seems to be the current Yelp running gag). I mean, as much as people romanticize sushi, it originated as street fast food! Then again, that sounds like fast food heaven to me.\n\nI think I have The Avengers on the brain, but Kabuto is like Captain America. He's a little old fashioned. But as Agent Coulson states, sometimes we need a little old fashioned. Actually, Kabuto is like The Avengers film itself. No matter how elevated your expectations are, you won't walk away disappointed.\n\nJiro dreams of sushi. I daydream of returning to Kabuto.","useful":16,"funny":12,"cool":14}

Beautifully minimalist with clean lines and nice small details\n\nService: Poor. \nWaitresses were difficult to communicate with and frankly a bit awkward both over the phone and in person. They didn't explain the very simple menu options, mixed up our order, and the timing of the food service was off (friend was almost done with his sashimi before I got my first bite of food). \nAs for our sushi chef, he clearly was an apprentice and served the sushi way too quickly to the point where I felt rushed. He also never made an effort to engage us in conversation or describe what he was serving beyond the name of the fish and where it came from. This was very disappointing as interacting with the chef  is usually a highlight of eating at a sushi bar for me.\n\nFood: Mostly just ok, but the uni\/ikura (that's sea urchin and salmon roe to the uninitiated) dish was amazing.  I ordered the nigiri tasting menu and while thought the fish was fresh and well prepared, there was no flow to the meal and most of the pieces were nothing special taste-wise, The toro handroll at the end was very very good despite being quite simple.\n\nOverall: Lots of hype but doesn't deliver.

There was nothing all that special or unique about their fish when you compare it to other higher end restaurants. The most unique thing I noticed was how small all their portions of fish were.  I am not advocating disgustingly large portions as is typical with many American restaurants but this was a bit ridiculous to me. We spent around 200 per person ordering both omakase and a la carte.

Your meal is paced much, much slower than an AYCE restaurant, with only one item being served to you at a time.  Each piece of nigiri is prepared in front of you, with the sushi chef telling you about the fish and its country of origin.  Everything being served has gone from the ocean to Kabuto's kitchen in a span of 24 hours or less.  You can start calling at 3:30pm to see what fish has been delivered for that day.

Also, the glass that it came in had an eggy smell that results from not drying too well in a dishwasher. \n\nThe appetizer was an octopus seaweed, cucumber salad which was great. the nigiri was great for the most part and the ANAGO and UNI were amazing. The initial couple of nigiri servings were good from a texture standpoint, but the soy that they glaze on it made the first few taste the same. Also, they served the dreaded Omlette\/egg nigiri which I loathe. I'm not sure if I could have asked them to give me something else instead of the egg. I dont understand who likes that stupid lump of cold egg. \n\nThey had a couple of kinds of toro which was great and the miso was wonderful and the service was very nice and attentive as well.

Oh and I almost forgot the warm rice that's part of the nigiri - this is the first time I've had warm rice in my nigiri (including my dining in Tokyo) and warm rice is wonderful.\n\nCouple of suggestions that I would give them:\n1. The sushi is served fresh one after the other when you order the omakase. This makes the experience kind of rushed as I finish one piece of nigiri and they immediately give me the next to eat. I would prefer it if they gave me half of my ten pieces first and let me slowly enjoy the experience while drinking some sake and then brought out the next 5. \n\n2. The chef tells you what you are eating, but it's hard to understand him. It would be great if you can mark off the fish that you served on the menu of the day that you provide which is disposable anyway. \n\n3. Give me the option to exclude the omlette\/egg sushi. \n\nI'll definitely be back to try the yoroi omakase next time and hopefully ask them to incorporate the above suggestions :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Ikura is usually so salty the only taste I get is the salt and the texture.

And before you even begin to read this, if you're just a casual sushi eater - like, you love yourself some cream cheese in your rolls or maybe your favorite roll is a California roll, then just don't even bother reading this or eating here.  THEY DON'T EVEN SERVE ROLLS!!  BUT if you're a real sushi lover, or foodie in general, then DEFINITELY EAT HERE!!  I have eaten sushi all over the world, from Japan to Hawaii to Portugal, at some of the best restaurants there are, and I can tell you hands down that this place is by far THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANT I've ever eaten at, and it continues to be after many years of eating here.  I am in Vegas often on business and every time I am, I make sure I partake in the amazingness that is Kabuto.  The best way to describe the style is that it's very traditional, the way it's served in the amazing documentary \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\".  Except none of the chefs are mean! hah.  Anyway, they always have fresh fish flown in from all over the world, so you get to taste some really wild stuff!  I ate there last night and they had barracuda on the menu, and I've never seen that before.  You can do three different types of courses, ranging from I believe about 4 - 8 courses.  During the sushi portion, the chef will serve you 5 or so of his choice selections from the menu, one at a time.  After that, you can select more that you may way to try from the menu.  This is definitely the best part of the meal!  You can see the menu from last night in the pics I posted if you'd like to see an example of the craziness you'll get here (Note, I am trying to figure out how to post pics!).  Place is small, I definitely recommend eating at the sushi bar so you can all the goings-on.  Sake menu changes and I've never ordered a bottle I didn't fully enjoy.  Costwise, of course, it's expensive!  $40 Bottle of sake and the middle tasting menu ran me about $180 with tip.  If you're going here expect to pay like it's the best sushi you've ever had, and prepare to not regret it!!!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

And the cardinal rule of evaluating Japanese food in the US with naive audiences?  Don't compare with what you can get in Japan--you aren't there and it's irrelevant.\n\nHaving said that, Kabuto comes VERY close to eating at a PROPER sushiya in Japan.  In some respect, it might be better than a LOT of proper places in Ginza as Kabuto has a good, I mean GOOD selection of white fish from Kyushu which a lot of edomae places in Tokyo who get fish from Tsukiji don't, but that's another story.  As some of us know, edomae really doesn't exist if you know what that really means besides from the style. \n\nI wonder how many authentic sushiyas are in the U.S. that didn't sell out and start making weird rolls.

My friend ordered the nigiri omakase, while I ordered the Yoroi omakase (which includes sashimi and grill dishes). Both the hold and cold dishes were outstanding.

ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.  \n\nBefore all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene, Kabuto is the best in Vegas, but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted, it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.\n\nRambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So, big fish = raw, small fish = marinated, oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi, to inhibit spoilage.\n\nCulinary artistry \/ craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings,  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.\n\nAlthough you can order individual sushi, the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.\n\nSelections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.\n\nVery good quality, delicately seasoned, short grain rice.  Nice compaction, holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.  \n\nFor all its refinement, this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!\n\nHighly recommended.","useful":33,"funny":15,"cool":27}

But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.\n\nKabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. \n\nI was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.\n\nDessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.\n\nTo be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi \"joint\" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.","useful":40,"funny":18,"cool":33}

The omakase was just OK. The house plum sake was delicious, as the Japanese crepe cake.\nThe experience in between was decent. \nThe fact that the wait staff had to read off a cheat sheet what they were serving in a place with only 3 omakase options is a bit odd.\nOverall, the place is neat, meal was decent (although not that impressive for the cost). Lets face it, if one is a sushi chef taking pride in what you serve than step up and serve the finest fish instead of fish similar to any other sushi restaurant .\nOverall, a decent place with some good things but the \"grill\" plate is quite mediocre. \nEnjoy the sake, Kampai!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I actually loved not having soy sauce on the table as it forced me to really savor the chef's vision for each bite. The rice was correctly prepared and gave the fish a nice little bite.

I have had a lot of great sushi in Hawai'i, NYC and Japan so my sushi standards are a bit ridiculous, but this place completely blew me away and is one of the best omakase I have EVER had in my life. For those of you visiting Vegas, resist the temptation to stay on the strip - GO HERE! It's a quick 10 min away and is better than any sushi you'll find on the strip (sans Masa). \n\nWe made reservations for 4 people on a Saturday night at 8:30pm only a few days in advance which was a miracle in itself. We ordered the $120 Kabuto omakase (their largest option), along with a small bottle of Dassai sake upon the waitress's recommendation. The omakase featured 9 courses of plates. We started with a refreshing apple-infused sake concoction to cleanse your palate. Next was a pairing of ika\/tako over mozuku + katsuo sashimi with daikon. Third featured an assortment of 10 pieces of 5 kinds of sashimi. Fourth was a hot plate from the kitchen of 5 types of fish or meat dishes. The fifth\/sixth\/seventh courses were sushi. We had 2 plates of 5 pieces of nigiri of both beloved favorites and specialty items that were exquisitely executed. The akamutsu, murasaki uni, and kamashita toro were stand-out pieces, although to be fair, every single piece was a melt-in-you-mouth tear-inducing piece of heaven. Then, Kabuto did something that is one of the coolest features of an omakase menu I've ever experienced... we got to PICK OUR OWN last 2 pieces and there were essentially no restrictions!!! What a novel idea - I can't believe more places don't do this. I was also just extremely impressed by the variety and quality of the fish selection. I chose to have another piece of the murasaki uni and I tried the aburi toro which was incredible. Finally, we ended the sushi courses with a negi toro handroll. Our eight course was  a generous portion of miso soup, and we had the option of choosing shrimp or fish (I chose the shrimp). Finally, as if I wasn't already full 5 courses ago, we ended the meal with dessert of our choice. I picked the sesame flan which had an incredible aroma and taste to it. \n\nI cannot say enough good things about Kabuto, there are simply no words to express. Put as concisely as possible, the price\/value here is the best I've ever seen. The $120 omakase was almost too much food, and I actually think I'll get the smaller omakase next time because my stomach just couldn't fit all the food in it. Everything is extremely fresh, the selection is out of this world, and the portions are the most generous I've seen. \n\nThe restaurant is minimalist, casual, clean, quiet and plays beautiful Japanese traditional music in the background. One of my biggest pet peeves is when authentic Japanese sushi bars are playing some random hip hop or top 40 playlist. And, finally, of course the service was IMPECCABLE. \n\nThis is my new favorite sushi restaurant. I wish I lived in Vegas.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Supporting patron for over 10 years! I went with a group of 8 people can left dismayed and disappointed. The ambiance was very chic, simplistic, and quiet tranquil. There were two sushi men, one who was the main guy at Sushimon then Goyemon and another Japanese guy. I was pleased to see all Japanese sushi chefs :) \n\nWe were all sat at their back table. There were also two Japanese female servers. We all ordered the Nigiri Course ($48) and were thrilled to start the  edomae sushi presentation. We were first presented with a pinapple flavored sake accompanied by  a small appetizer with fresh grated wasabi, okra, 3 cubs of lean tuna (from Spain), thin slices of cucumber and seaweed. It was good and you can taste the high quality of the tuna. The second, third, and fourth presenation was followed by an assortment of 9 pieces of nigiri. Of the assortment several pieces were delicious like the parrot fish, sweet lips, stripped pig (sounds exotic huh?!). If you have been a fan of Sushimon and Goyemon you will notice that there were many cuts of fish that you cannot find at any other sushi place. However compared to the pieces that were given at the bar, we found our pieces of fish so thin and very little rice. After the end of your nigiri dishes the server asks if you would like to purchase or order any additional fish. Keep in mind our party of 8 was divided into 2 tables. My friend and I (sitting at separate tables)  ordered the fresh sweet shrimp (so plump, lightly sweet, and tender). I repeated the order 3 separate times to the server to make sure that she understands. However,  she still had some confusion and two pieces were given to my friend at the other table. I asked the server I had also ordered one and she said it was coming out. She said that since the shrimp was large, they cut the shrimp in half and made two pieces. Well one of those pieces, turned out, was supposed to be mine. While I was waiting for my piece  (ten mins), I was getting so impatient because another couple who had entered later then us were already done.  I yelled at the server and asked her when i was getting my sweet shrimp! She said 'the other piece was yours!'..... OMG!!!! #1) if we were all given separate plates for our orders, why would you place two pieces on one plate #2) we sat at separate tables so why would they we together on one plate?! Our whole course took an unnecessary 2 1\/2 hours. We were waiting almost 20 between each course, yet they were quick to take our plates :( \n\nOkay, my review is turning into a disaster and I really didnt want to write this review because we truly do love and support Sushimon & Goyemon..... my boyfriend and I go at least once every few weeks :( \n\nBefore you go, here are some helpful tips in order to get your $48 worth \n#1. Do not go in big groups (bigger than 4) because you will get sat at a table. The $48 you pay isnt just for the high quality sushi but you are buying the whole experience; like interacting with the sushi chef, seeing your fish being cut, etc. \n\n#2. When you make reservations, ask to be sat at the sushi bar\n\n#3. While the fish was spectacular, the pieces were so small. You will leave hungry so many stop by Monta Noodle for a snack to fill you up :) \n\n#4. The dessert was fabulous! My boyfriend and I ordered homemade mochi ice cream (peanut butter, green tea, citrus) and strawberry crepe cake (7 layers of crepe). Highly recommend these two items! \n\n#5. Remember this is not an AYCE place so don't expect to leave full! You are paying for the edomae sushi  experience and the fish that is flown in from Japanese. \n\nAfter this whole disaster, my boyfriend and I will give this place another try. Hopefully after following our own tips, we will have a better experience! : )","useful":11,"funny":1,"cool":2}

My server was helpful but also attentive enough not to be overly intrusive.\n\nSo, in terms of food...  Kabuto focuses on edomae sushi. This is as traditional a style of sushi as you can get and is considered to be the highest form of sushi around. There is a devoted attention to the freshness and flavors of fish.  You're not going to find a California roll here.\n\nMy friends and I ordered the Kabuto Omakase course.  This 7-course meal comes with aperitif sake, appetizer, sashimi platter (5 kinds), grill platter (5 varaieties), nigiri (12pc), hand roll, miso soup, and a dessert.  \n\nEverything I had was amazing and incredibly fresh.  We had everything from uni flown in from Japan to many different types of fatty tuna to even cod milt miso soup (milt being the male reproductive organ).\n\nIt's certainly not a cheap place but for a sushi lover, the food and experience is definitely worth the money.

Anyways, after quite a lengthy search, I came across Kabuto and immediately called to make reservations, a month in advance. \n\nThis chic little sushi spot is in the heart of Chinatown surrounded by tons of restaurants, massage parlors, and shops. If you don't know what you're looking for, you'll probably miss it. There's a shop next door with a GIANT spoon, Bingo! You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. \n\nOnce you walk in, there's a long sushi bar that seats ~10 and 3-4 tables that seats medium sized groups, a total of 22 or so, I believe. They have two seatings a night. One at 6:00pm (not 6:30, remember this!) and one at 8:30pm. Reservations are required and you'll likely be turned away without them since they even have wait lists for the evening. It's a pretty low key atmosphere and very simply decorated. \n\nWe show up all fance and I excitedly give them my name and...and...and... they tell me they don't have a seat for me. For some reason, I thought our reservation was for 6:30 and not 6:00! They gave our seats away (after calling, except my phone was at the Apple store and they had no way to reach me). The lady said if we wanted to get on the wait list for the night she would put us on there. So, with no hopes of dining at Kabuto I left with no appetite for anything else and the saddest face ever. \n\nAn hour or so later, ring ring, it's Kabuto!! There was another party that was a no show and they ask if we'd still like to dine there tonight. Um YESPLEASEOMG. \n\nWe go all the way back to Chinatown, and upon arrival are seated at the end of the bar. We decide on the Kabuto menu, serving Edomae tradition of sushi. It's a pretty penny but 1000bajillion and 1% worth it. They start you off with a delicious house-made sake which sets you up for how delicious the meal is.\n\nCourse after course, everything was plated beautifully, absolutely delicious, and the service was impeccable. \n\nWe were chatting with the sushi chef that mentioned the fish comes straight from Japan with a 17 hour turn around. SEVENTEEN HOURS. HOLY COW (err FISH), this place is another level. The quality, freshness, and deliciousness is probably the closest you'll get to being in Tokyo, outside of Tokyo.\n\nShoutouts to my faves: fresh wasabi, wakaremi, kamasu, ma-tai and the escargot.\n\nEvery bite you eat here will be just as good as the last you ate, if not better.","useful":21,"funny":10,"cool":17}

I ordered the eggplant parmesan which I wasn't too fond of.  I found it to be too breaded and mushy, not what I'm used to.  Otherwise, great atmosphere, great prices.

With so many options on the strips, I was wondering why this was one of her favorites. Located in the Fashion Show Mall, the restaurant has easy access and parking. It has a great location. \n\nThe ambiance is just like every other Maggianos, with only about 1\/3 of the tables having a view of the strip. We had made reservations for 8:00pm on a Wednesday night, and arrived 10 minutes late. Granted the restaurant was packed as ever, but there were empty tables. The Maître de gave us such a stern look of disapproval and then gave us a buzzer to wait near the bar. We waited for almost another 25 minutes, are you kidding me? \n\nWhen we were finally seated at a table in the back, it took us way longer than expected to get the attention of the waiter to take our order. Maybe they have a problem with the ratio of tables per waiter. We could see that he was working hard, but we were hungry as well! The food was delicious, as expected. All of us were stuffed and enjoyed our meal. We actually loved the two elderly men who came to sing at our table =) The one with the Violin reminded us of the man in UP. With such good food, we were happy to have several boxes of leftovers to enjoy the next day. \n\nBut then, at the end of the night when we were paying the bill, we asked the waiter to split the bill amongst the guests. One of our friends actually paid in cash and the waiter actually assumed that his bill was his tip. This is before we got the receipt back to sign. The waiter assumed, and gave himself a 25% tip! That has never happened to me before, and sadly I have to say he didn't deserve it. Overall we had a great time and I wouldn't mind coming back, but I would hope they would improve on their service between then.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I was skeptical to try Maggiano's out since they were a chain restaurant but I would be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately no locations in Canada (where I'm from) yet! This Maggianos is located in the Fashion show mall next to Wynn and Encore Hotels. \n\nMaggiano's isn't exactly fine-dining, but it does have a pretty nice ambiance for a family style restaurant. It has full panoramic glass windows around the perimeter of the dining room, showcasing an awesome view of the Wynn hotel and that part of the strip. While we were there, two violinists went around the restaurant playing songs for each table. And to top it off, our server was so kind and helpful!\n\nThe menu here is also pretty interesting and worth a mention. Along side the regular a la cart menu, they also have a \"family style\" menu. Basically you choose several items from a predetermined set, and for a fixed price per pereson, you can order as much of any item you want! Its kind of like \"all-you-can-eat\" but for only the few items you choose. We ended up going for this option and ordered the light family dinner that comes with bottomless portions for 2 appetizers, 2 salads, and 2 pastas.\n\nMaggiano's Salad : \nThis salad is literally the best salad I've ever had! The signature house dressing was a spicy-sweet vinaigrette, and paired with the crunchy prosciutto bits, I could NOT for the life of me stop eating this!\n\nCrispy Zucchini Fritte : \nThe waiter said this was their most popular appetizer, and I can see why. The zucchinis are deep fried in a crumbly crunchy batter, and were irresistible with the cool ranch dip\n\nLinguine and Clams with White Clam Sauce: \nI did not like this at all. The sauce was runny, and tasted like fishy sea water. It was way too salty.\n\nOur Famous Rigatoni 'D' ® :\n guess they don't call it \"Famous\" for nothing, this pasta is really really good! The pasta is cooked perfectly al dente, and is served with lots of mushrooms and creamy Marsala sauce. \n\nFor a chain, this place really isn't bad!

Not usually a fan of big chains, but I just love them. I have one close to where I live and ate there only because we had been given a gift certificate. \n\nWhile in Vegas with my family, I insisted we have a big family meal at Maggiano's. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday night. \n\nWe arrived on time, but had to wait more than thirty minutes to be seated. The place was totally packed, so we had to stand, smashed together, in the bar area while we waited. That sucked, and made me wonder why we bothered with reservations.\n\nOur server was extremely busy (there was an 18 top in our section), but he did a fantastic job, considering how busy he was, and how many questions and picky orders my family came up with.\n\nThe food was fantastic. I ordered the spinach artichoke appetizer and the eggplant parmesan. Everyone at the table absolutely loved the spinach artichoke. However, we prefered it on the table bread, as opposed to the \"crostini\" it's served with. The little pieces of crostini are too small and too hard for the yummilicious, creamy, piping hot, rich spinach artichoke dip. \n\nMy eggplant parm was beautiful and delicious. Unfortunately, in total vegas style, it was enormous. A small family could have shared it (I have a big family....haha). It was just perfect. I'm not used to whole pieces of roasted garlic in my eggplant parm, but they were delightful little treats to discover here and there. It couldn't have been better, honestly. Four meals came out of it- the one that night, a midnight snack later, my meal on the plane the next day, and my husband's lunch the next day. It was even delicious cold!\n\nFor desert, my sister ordered the 5 desert platter. It had tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, apple pie ala mode, and....I can't remember the last one. It was so pretty- and only $9.95. The whole table shared it, and we still had leftovers. I'm not a fan of sweets, so I only nibbled a couple things. My sister said it was the best cheesecake she'd ever had.\n\nAll in all, it was a fantastic night. I remember sitting back for a moment, looking around the table... everyone was laughing, eating, and having a wonderful time.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It turned out to be a great decision.\n\nLocation-wise, it was very easy for our guests to get to from the Wynn. We had a couple of older relatives, and being able to drive up to the valet area and drop them off was super.\n\nPlanning - the banquet staff was responsive and accommodating. They also took care of everything - saving us the hassle of trying to manage multiple vendors. We selected the cocktail reception package. After signing the initial contract, the only other planning we had to do was answer the occasional email about headcount or food and beverage choices.\n\nFacilities- beautiful banquet room. Our decorations were minimal (some flowers on the tables), but that's all the place really needed. Maggiano's let us drop off the decorations the morning-of, and the banquet staff did a knock-out job of decorating the room for us. We rented out all 3 portions of the banquet room, which was great for our 100-person reception. We also got access to the terrace, which was great for the smokers, let us enjoy a view of the strip, and kept the temperature perfect for the event.\n\nFood & staff - amazing. Everyone loved the food. The staff was quick to respond when food ran out in the banquet lines - new food came out fresh and hot. Bar tending staff was awesome - no one waited in line very long. Also, the staff made my husband, myself, and our photographer \"to go\" boxes with extra food because they were afraid we didn't get enough to eat. How awesome is that?\n\nDo yourself a favor and let the awesome staff at Maggiano's handle your reception. Professional, painless, and the end to a perfect day.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The atmosphere inside is elegant, but comfortable. The private room was perfect in size with a large bar at the front and a balcony overlooking the strip. The service during the reception was stellar. I told our bartender\/server about my gluten allergy and she was immediately able to identify substitutions and alternate courses for me that would meet my needs. She knew exactly what to do and made me feel at ease right away. I had an awesome chopped salad to start with that made the other non-gluten free people around me jealous. Then I enjoyed marsala mushroom and chicken gluten free pasta. Oh my God, it was out of this world. I need to go to the Maggiano's and Tampa ASAP to have this again. Finally for dessert, I had the creme brulee, again making everyone around me jealous. The meal was unbelievable!! Kudos to the staff and chef at Maggiano's for making the whole night perfect both for guests and for the bride and groom. I have not visited an Italian restaurant since I learned of my allergy but now I absolutely have to go back to Maggiano's.  If you are in Vegas, definitely make this a dinner spot at least one night of your stay.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Lets talk about some of my favorite things to order.\n\nRight from the start the warm bread basket is fantastic please enjoy the top notch virgin olive oil and the best balsamic vinegar i have ever had! \nSome of my favorite appetizer are bruschetta, a simple but very tasty plate, the chopped salad or any of their salads are great and large enough to share and though i personally am not a fan of calamari my grandma and fathers side of the family who are 100% Sicilian i may add rave about it and order it every time we go! \nAs for main course you can't go wrong with any of their pasta dishes which i can almost guarantee you will have some left over to take home! My favorite, though it is another simple classic dish, is the spaghetti and meatballs i absolutely love it! The chicken parm is fantastic as well! In all honesty their are more great dishes here than i can name in this review!\nNow for desert, if you were able to save room go for it or you can be like me and get a piece of tripple layer chocolate cake to go, it is extremely rich and very well made the cheesecake is very good as well! \n\nI strongly reccomend this restaurant and as i said in the beggining it is one of the better places to take a date especially if you want to impress, once again please make reservations for less wait time but if there is a little wait they have a great little bar area you can grab a few cocktails relax and socialize!

Of course, we can't possibly eat there all the time, so during our last Las Vegas trip we also tried Maggiano's Little Italy. I understand this is a national chain (one which I wasn't aware of at all up until now), but if you didn't know that you would assume this was a single independently owned restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice, but not pretentious. Service was rapid and very personable. Like many Italian restaurants, especially on the strip in Vegas, this place is fairly expensive, but if you do not go crazy on drinks and appetizers there are several reasonably priced entrees on the menu. Our bill with tip was under $35, which is very reasonable for the large portions we received, as well as the quality of food and service we experienced. We experienced no real negatives, and the view outside of the Vegas strip while we were dining indoors was spectacular. They also have outdoor seating, though it is limited in the number of available tables. One minor complaint is that they could turn down the air conditioning a notch, but that is a common complaint anywhere indoors in Vegas, not limited solely to this restaurant. We've experienced much colder air conditioning elsewhere in Vegas. They also did not serve butter with there bread, but brought us some butter promptly when we asked for it. Their to-go boxes are of high quality and very usable aluminum. Portion sizes were large enough for us to have leftovers we ended up taking with us on our flight back home. My daughter ended up eating that, and she was very impressed - even though the food had just been reheated in a microwave, instead of more properly in an oven. For the price, this is a well located and enjoyable Italian restaurant. It is well worth checking out in comparison to some of the more outrageously priced (for Arab sheiks?) Italian restaurants on the strip.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":2}

I am not  a connoisseur of  Italian eateries, but I have been to enough  Italian restaurants in my time to give a solid review. First, my friends and I made reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday evening 3 days in advance. We get to the restaurant at 6:55pm and the hostess gave  us the pager gadget and says it will be a few minutes. Half an hour later, we still have not been seated yet. I wonder why we  even bothered to make reservations. In my book, you make a reservation for a certain time and when that time comes,  you get seated. that is the point of making a RESERVATION and the basic meaning of the word. This is a big NO NO in my book. That is either poor planning or mismanagement or both. If I am gonna spend some bills in a fancier style restaurant, I expect to be taken care of. that is what I am paying for and have no problem doing so.  The silver lining ,if there is one, is that we weren't the only ones. there were numerous folks there having the same frustrations and issues with this topic and wishing to speak to the manager. Not a good sign. the waitress was nice enough and adequate though. the only issue I had with her is that we got our vinegar and oil for our bread, but guess what, no bread. only after 20 minutes and asking did we receive our bread. again, not what I expect from a  purported higher class establishment. the food was adequate but not what I would call earth shattering. the calamari was tasty and the Rigatoni D was tasty and sauce was good. I have had better and worse.  my friends all liked what they got from what they told me. Overall, mediocre experience at best.One thing I have learned over the years is that  you can tell a lot about a place by the way they keep the bathrooms and I must say that was horrible and maybe the worst I have ever seen except for a few roadside gas stations in my days. It  was an absolute mess with dirty paper towels, water, all over the floor and overall condition to be filthy. again, I hope they don't keep the kitchen like the do the restroom. I don't even want to think about that.  Overall, not a horrible experience but not one for the books either. In my opinion, Carrabas easily matches and super cedes Maggianos overall for a much better eating experience and price. Oh,  Almost forgot, I will give a 4 or 5 on the overall ambiance and feel of the restaurant.  It was a comfortable and luxurious setting, and decorated nicely but unfortunately, the wrapping on the package was much better than the gift inside.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When we arrived the restaurant was not busy at all but were told that the wait would be 45 minutes-1 hour.  This was after waiting for at least 5 minutes, standing right in front of the desk, with no one in front of me and the 2 people at the desk didn't even acknowledge that I was there!  We decided to sit in the bar area so we could eat sooner.\n\nWe were worried that with the small number of servers there our service would be slow.  But the service from our waitress was actually the best part of our experience there.  We were able to order relatively quickly (I didn't expect superfast service sitting in the bar) but our food arrived and one order was wrong while another was missing a crucial ingredient.  Our waitress immediately apologized and worked to get it fixed.  She blamed the errors on the kitchen - I have no idea what was the cause but it didn't really matter.  In the end one of our party was unable to get her order fixed and ended up boxing it to take home...after waiting over 30 minutes to get the missing ingredient.\n\nOur waitress took that order off the bill which was very generous (and naturally resulted in a very generous tip).  But we were disappointed with the number of errors with our food and slowness in having them fixed by the kitchen.  If the kitchen staff were having a \"bad day\" the management should have been fixing it.  I live here in Las Vegas and normally go to Maggiano's almost every time I go to Fashion Show, but after this experience I have no plans to eat here again.  Hopefully the management will see this review and get their stuff together!","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

First of all, the food was terrible. Over salted. Just awful.  Second they ran out of food, or perhaps do not know how to plan well.  Third, they ran TWO HOURS late for our confirmed reservation!\nRidiculous- ran out of proscuitto for their own Maggiano's salad!  They obviously were running low on food by the time we were seated. (5:15 reservation, seated at 7:15!)\nFor seven adults, they place two ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes on a small plate in the center of the table-for seven people!  Then the turkey platter looked like  a sad plate of leftovers-and had one little mound of stuffing- which was gone after it was passed to the second person. We kept thinking that was decoration, and they would bring some in a bowl (aka family style). Same for the ham platter, one little scoop of sweet potatoes for seven adults!  The pasta course however, was abundant --apparently the only thing they know how to cook.  They brought two big bowls of pasta for side dishes. Everything was horribly over salted!  The gravy -also they must have been running out of...was a tiny little coffee cup sized dish of milky white looking blah gravy??   I cannot repeat enough it was HORRIBLE.

The rudest staff and establishment I have ever dealt with. I booked my reservation a few days ahead of time for 7:45 pm. Due to Las Vegas traffic and a double overtime basketball game I attended, our party arrived at approximately 7:55. I checked in to the front desk and said hello. To which I was not greeted and immediatly asked for the reservation name. I provide the name and am told that due to my lateness, keep in mind I am 10 minutes late to a reservation at a restaurant, they marked me as a no show and notified the yelp reservation site. At this point I am already annoyed, but I am on vacation and starving so I state the reason for my 10 minutes of tardiness. I continue and ask if we  can get another table. The \"greeter\" says I will have to wait at the end of the line for an hour to two hour  wait . I am still calm at this point and oblige to stand and wait. A minute passes and a heavy set supervisor type asks my party to move from the desk area. We move over to the corner by a coat rack. Another minute passes, the supervisor again states to move away from the coat rack area also. With my patience drawing low, I move over again to another open spot in the corner. After a couple minutes the supervisor AGAIN states to move away from this new spot. Not once does he show us another place to stand, nor does he say please or  thank you or anything but move. Rather, he comes off as annoyed at the fact that we are occupying space and breathing within the reastaurant. Finally, we have had enough and call the manager . A \"manager type\" scaddadles over after about 15 minutes and says whats wrong. We tell him the situation and he coldly replies that he is busy and the we missed our reservation time. Also so, he has no suggestion as to where to stand and wait in the restaurant. We left. Ridiculous service by a faux Italian establishment that has not the slightest idea about Italian culture, gratitude or hosting.

It was busy, but the very friendly hostess squeezed us in with a 45 min wait.  Not a problem for us, considering we had no reservation and we were waiting for the rest of our party.  Our buzzer was activated almost exactly 45 mins after we spoke with the hostess.  We were seated just about 5 minutes later at a great table facing their floor to ceiling windows which looked out toward Encore, Wynn and Palazzo.  It was a great view at 6:30pm.  \n\nThe food was excellent. Our order included garlic bread, zucchini fritte, shrimp scampi, shrimp tropheo, lemon chicken and salmon oscar.  Everyone enjoyed their a la carte entrees.  The scampi and tropheo were both such large servings that 2 people could easily share.  Then we ordered dessert, their 5 item sampler, lemon cookies($2) and profiteroles ($2).  All was soooooo delicious!!  And their 5 item sampler was only $9.95 -- but each of the samples was a portion fit for one person as a normal serving!   All of the food tasted fresh and extremely flavorful.  Service could have been a bit faster but one has to take in to account that many large parties go to this location on The Strip at Fashion Show.  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful.  Other workers also pitched in when we asked for anything.  \n\nParking is a bit unconventional, especially if you dine at late evening\/night because obvious parking would in the mall's garages.  However the Mall does not stay open as late as Maggiano's.  I would suggest parking at a casino across the street to save yourself the confusion.\n\nAll in all, the experience was great and the price was not bad either.  For all items listed above, the total came to about $150 and fed 4 adults and one child with leftovers.  I will be going back in the future and would happily suggest Maggiano's to anyone!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The place was crowded, but that was not so much of an issue. The noise level in the restaurant was pretty high, but if you are lucky you might get a table with a good view of the strip.\n\nWe ordered the steamed mussels and crab cakes for appetizer.

Kids ate the flat bread pizza and spaghetti with giant meatball.\n\n- Crab cakes were okay, the sauce that comes with it is nice\n- Mussels in red sauce (Diablo if I remember well). When served they smelled funny. My first impression was that the mussels were steamed and a can of crushed tomatoes was thrown over them. Some spaghetti strings were visible, so I was wondering where the sauce really came from?! But, that was not the problem; the smell was just unbearable that I could not eat these mussels. Returned them and was notified by the waitress that it was not the first time that the mussels smelled. Manager came and offered us another dish, we ordered the fried calamari ... and it was okay.\n- Salmon on a bed of spinach with roasted potatoes; the salmon was a bit overcooked and was sitting in the juices of the spinach. Not very appetizing to see, I like grilled fish to remain dry when served. The potatoes were really overcooked and very dry on the inside ... they were left to roast just beyond what they needed.\n- Flat bread pizza, not too bad for a kids meal\n- Spaghetti with giant meatball; I am not sure what people like about \"giant\" food, but for me it looks disgusting. \n\nWe were not charged for the mussels nor for the fried calamari, which is great customer service. \n\nOverall, maybe worth a two or three star but definitely not more than that if you grade it on the food.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

She lied!!!!!\n\nFrom when we sat down to when we were served our appetizers, an hour had gone by.  When we asked the waitress about our appetizers, she became a  little aggressive and said she was doing the best she could.  When we finally got our appetizers, we asked her to bring the main course as soon as possible, didn't know how long we would have to wait. \n\nFood not bad but certainly not impressed with the waitress.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We were immediately seated and service was prompt.  \nThe appetizer we chose which was stuffed mushrooms was quite delicious and I would order these again.\nMy dish was a Shrimp Risotto which wasn't a part of the regular menu, but a special they had.  I thought it was good, but it didn't \"wow\" me.  I probably wouldn't order it again.\nMy mom had a Beef Tenderloin dish...and because she invariably cannot finish her meal, she offered some to me.  I found the beef to be very good, and in fact wished I had ordered that instead.\nMy brother ordered a Lobster Carbonara dish which he was disappointed with because they mistakenly did not put bacon in the dish...even though it is listed and most carbonara's should have it.  I got a bite of the lobster in it and thought it was okay.\nOverall, the meal was good and I would probably eat here again, but would try another dish.  The prices here are not too bad.

Yelp and other online reviews were great so we thought we will give it a try. As soon as we went inside, they said the wait time is 15' which wasn't too bad. My sis-in-law had a baby so she had a stroller with her and baby was asleep at that time. After 15' we went inside and they said the stroller is not allowed. My sis-in-law explained that the baby is asleep and it would be nice of them to accommodate the stroller. The waiter told to some lady and she allowed to have the stroller inside. The stroller was kept near the pillar so that it is not in anyone's way. We had 2-3 different servers for this visit. One took the order for water. The round table had 5 chairs but only 3 appetizer plates on them! We were total 4. Had to tell the waiter to get us 1 more plate. Then we had ordered 2 soups (tomato-basil) and since they did not split in half, we had asked for separate bowls. They brought the soup but not bowls! Although we told them to get the bowls, after drinking half the soup from the bowl, still we did not get the empty bowls. Then we told another server to get the bowls. By the time we got empty bowls, soup was done! we had shared from the same bowl.However, apart from their service, the Soup tasted Excellent! For the appetizer, we had ordered Fried Mozzarella with Marinara Sauce on top. The Mozzarella was Terrific and too heavy. We got 4 pieces and just 1 piece filled our stomach! I will surely recommend Tomato-basil soup and Fried Mozzarella! \nFor entree, we had Angel Primavera with vegetables and 4 Cheese Ravioli. Since we are vegetarians, We had Angel Primavera with vegetables. Although, the taste was blend, except for me, rest 3 of them liked it. To me it was okay. I would have loved it with extra sauce, seasonings and olive oil. It looked bit dry. The 4 Cheese Ravioli was Excellent. Very creamy light green color sauce and light marinara on top of ravioli and soft cheese inside the ravioli and nicely baked cheese on top. Again the Ravioli filled us up with all the cheese..! Lastly we thought (not me as my stomach was Full) to try their 5 Pc Dessert since it looked nice when they brought out for others! well, truly nobody liked any of the dessert except 1 person liked 1 of the dessert. I personally will not recommend the 5 pc dessert. 1 was Tirmasu cake-was ok.\n1 was cheese cake-no no, 1 was Apple Crostada-no no, 1 Butter Cake -no-ok, creme brulee-ok-good. \nFood Taste Overall -4 *\nFood Taste for Appetizer and Entrees - 5*\nService- 4*\nDessert Taste- 1*\nDecor and feel - 5*\nCost- Fried Mozzarella (4 piece)-$11.95\n         2 Bowl Tomato Soup ($5.95 each)-$11.90\n        Angel Primavera -$13.95\n        4 Cheese Ravioli- $15.95\n        5 Pc Dessert - $12.95\nTotal - $66.70\nTax: $5.44\nTotal - $72.14 for 4 people.\nI will surely recommend this restaurant on the strip!!!

It had a big windown that you can see part of the Las Vegas strip from. Lots of light.\n\nThe dinner was sit-down buffet style. We had three courses: Appetizer, Main course and dessert. The food was awesome, most especially because there was only one dish with tomatoes! This was a special Italian restaurant and I was so happy to be able to try all their food.\n\nThe salad was excellent: fresh lettuce, blue cheese and dressing. There were two types, but I didn't get to taste the other one. The calamari was really good, too.\n\nThe cheese ravioli was a big hit at our table. Something so simple was so delicious, and felt so light in your mouth. There was chicken florentine, a steak with mushroom and then eggplant parmesian. I heard that this one was the best dish out of the main course, but i couldn't sample it. Guess why? :P\n\nThe dessert was cheesecake with strawberries, as well as a fruit plate with pineapples, honeydew, cantaloupes, grapes, strawberries, watermelons. Fresh. everything just tasted so fresh.\n\nThe best part of this dinner was that we found out that this reception place was a restaurant towards the front entrance. There is a full bar, and it looked like really efficient servers. They were all polite, too. \n\nThis is a place to definitely check out if you aren't interested in buffets, or just want to sample a different type of life with Vegas.

Don't you hate it when they keep trying to talk to you and just  go a bit too overboard and waaay too personal with the conversation. It was comment after comment. I could not really enjoy the  time with my friends. At first I felt bad but then I realized that he was borderline flirting with my girl friends. Especially in the end when my friend was trying to get out the booth and he extended his hand an exclaimed \" need some help miss\"? My friend politely said \"no thank you\". While I was thinking in my head \"WHAT A PERVERT\". To be honest, he probably gets off by touching women any chance he gets. \n\nMinus one star for the server that wouldn't shut up.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We split the bruschetta as an appetizer, and while it was delicious, for the price I was expecting a bit more.  However, they made up for portion sizes with the entrees!  My eggplant parmesam was posetively massive, but still elegantly served which I appreciated.  Another in our party had the chicken tortelloni's and the two others had the gnocchi.  Honestly, mine was pretty good but I liked everyone else's selections better.

I think the waiter returned with a few more pieces (there must have been a shortage of avocados that day). Plus, the dressing was a little weak and I could barely taste it  (they must have been short on that too).\n\ncream pasta with chicken dish- There was barely any sauce on this and what I did manage to get onto my pasta and fork, seemed to have a nice subtle taste to it. Would have been nice to be served pasta that glistened with sauce, instead of me looking and wondering if there was any on there to begin with.

It had obviously been left under a heat lamp because the plate rim was very hot, the food was only warm, and the sauce had started to congeal. I ate maybe a third of it and the bus boy came by and started clearing the dishes. What am I going to do, complain to him? My daughter ordered the filet with asparagus risoto. A bunch of under cooked asparagus, a reasonable amount of risoto and 3 little slices (2 ounces?) of well done beef (filet?) about the size of your little finger. By the way, she ordered it pink, which after verbally stumbling around we agreed was medium. More signs it sat under a heat lamp?","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

S swears this was a better place to buy a meal when last in Vegas.  They seated us right away on a Tuesday evening and the Cesar gave us stellar service.  This is Maggiano's so I didn't raise an eyebrow at $12 for a small glass of the \"house\" red (Cherry Tart pinot noir).  He recommended the risotto fritte for appetizer which I requested and we had the gnocchi in vodka sauce with Italian sausage and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The house bread they bring for free is awesome.  You can season some olive oil with pepper and Parmesan for dipping.  I'd say don't ruin your appetite but the quality of the food gave me pause to cancel that suggestion.  They served the risotto fritte quickly and upon seeing it, they are effectively arancini with pepperoni mixed in.  They are salty but dip it in the marinara they provide and they not only become brutally salty but the sauce obscures any subtlety of flavor in the balls.  By the time they brought our entrees I was starting to get full.  Both dishes suffered from the same affliction as the arancini.  Perfectly good pasta (wonderfully tender gnocchi especially) coated in supremely salty sauces.  I took a few forkfuls and asked for a box (as cold leftovers - once a lot of the sauce fell off was ok to eat).  About $75 for two with tip.  The waiter and staff definitely earned a top review and an extra star but considering the meal quality that only earns this place somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I even waited and double checked with our server that they didn't make a mistake and give me the bigger size bowl of soup and she said \"nope, that's the small one\". Well, the soup was delicious. It was full of mushrooms in a cream base and was sooooo yummyyy!!!  My mom ordered the \"small\" Spinach Salad and that was delicious as well. Never had roasted red peppers in a spinach salad and it surprisingly gave great flavor with the smoked bacon, crumbled gorgonzola, sweet onions and toasted pine nuts. We would have been just fine with our soup and salad but little did we know that the portions were going to be so huge!\n\nOkay, entree time...we both went with sandwhiches. I had the Jumbo Lump Crabcake Sandwhich (via their menu on the website...\"Crab cake on a brioche bun with arugula, tomato and crispy onion strings and mustard mayonnaise. Served with parmesan chips\") and my mom had the Seared Salmon Sandwhich (which is not listed on the menu online for some odd reason). THOSE WERE THE 2 BEST DAMN SANDWHICHES I'VE EVER HAD!!!!

Getting a group of females together to decided on 2 entrees, 2 salads, 2 apps is like filing your nails down a chalkboard.  Someone has to take control!  I ordered a Reisling and sat back to watch the fireworks show.  With large parties, the restaurant STRONGLY \"suggests\" ok forces you to have family style, which is FINE by me.  It actually works to your advantage because then you aren't squabling over the damn check.

It also turns out that I had some rewards points that could be turned into a gift card here, which presented the perfect opportunity. \n\nLet me first say, the hostess, manager, and our waiter especially were awesome! Professional, efficient, and very friendly. They seemed to be having a great time, which is always a good sign.\n\nThe food was also excellent. Between the three of us, we tried the lasagna (with marinara), lasagna (with meat sauce), and the Gnocchi & Italian Sausage dish. All were wonderful. \n\nAlso while dining, there were two musicians that came around and asked if you would like them to play the table a song - which similarly happens in Italy.

As you would expect from any decent Italian place the prices are a little high and being right in the fashion show mall doesn't help. Overall the food is great and the atmosphere is what you expect for what your paying. \n\nNow for my favorite part about this place. They have something called a Family style dinner. To order this you are required a party of 4. The cost is about $35 per person and completely worth it! This includes the following: two appetizers,two salads, two pastas, two entrees and a desert. Now you might be thinking wow that's a rip off? BUT WAIT there is more to this then meets the eye. All the items have to be selected off the pre-build family menu BUT the portions are UNLIMITED!! for instance if you order 2 appetizers and you greatly enjoy them tell the server and he will bring you another order of them. Same goes with the salad, pasta and everything else. The kicker here is that you ALSO get to take home your leftovers!\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Italian food! My personal favorite dish is the following.\n\nFour Cheese Ravioli +\nRavioli stuffed with ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella, and provolone filling sprinkled with house cheese, then browned in the oven and served in pesto-alfredo cream sauce with a touch of marinara. \n\nIt is AMAZING!

Hector was great. The food was fine. Nothing spectacular but not horrible either. I would probably go back just because I enjoy the location and the prices are decent. \nThe reason for the 2 stars is because of my experience in the bathroom. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before I ate, and a female server walks in (tall, dirty blonde hair, Caucasian) and starts to make a phone call on speaker. She then proceeds to raise her voice in anger and use profanity (the F word specifically)  while speaking to whomever she was speaking to. I think she said \"you tell her when I get home I'm going to f&$!ing kill her...\" or something similar to that. Now... I also work in a restaurant on the strip, and if any of our employees were to do that, we would be fired for sure. Maybe she's lucky I didn't say anything to a manager or she might be fired too, I don't know if they would even care. That server made Maggiano's look bad in my eyes and I'm sure anyone else would've thought the same thing. Perhaps you shouldn't allow your staff to use the same bathroom as your guests, and all this could've been avoided.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Maggiano's kept the Thanksgiving tradition of turkey and ham while leaving their signature Italian dishes within their prix fixe meals. To taste, the food was good but did it beat the home cooked meals? I still prefer home, but this works (especially when in Vegas!). Prix fixe approximately $50\/person. All dishes came in family style. Had plenty of leftovers, but in Vegas, where would one keep the leftovers unless you're staying in a place with a fridge? For the price, it was a very nice dinner. Here's our choices: \n\nTurkey, stuffing, gravy- typical dish. Turkey was tender! For having to serve a packed house, we were surprised they kept the juiciness of each turkey slice. Not enough gravy though. Cranberry sauce was very sour, so I skipped out on that sauce. \n\nGnocchi, sausage- Definitely surprised gnocchi was soft and chewy! A bit bland though. \n\nCaesar salad- typical. Enough dressing. Good!\n\nMaggiano's salad- yum! Bits of bacon and signature vinaigrette (sort of a light Italian dressing) was great! Could enjoy that next time we go back. \n\nTilapia on spinach bed- don't remember what sauce it was. Maybe white wine with cream. It was good, but again, a bit bland. \n\nMashed sweet potato- bland!!! No sweetness at all. Hated this side. \n\nCreamed corn- bland too! Sides were failures. \n\nChocolate cake- rich in flavor! Beats the bland food. Be sure to ask for coffee or hot tea or hot water. \n\nPumpkin cheesecake- typical. Was good but nothing amazing to say. \n\nCustomer service- quick with the meals! Didn't waste any time getting us our food. Thank goodness! We were hungry! Only suggestion would be to offer coffee, tea, or hot water before serving dessert. Server offered this after we were done with our dessert. Even when the other servers brought the desserts, we didn't see our main server.

Over the years she has spoken very highly of Maggianos.  Having never been before... a window of opportunity would present it's self to give it a shot.  The GF had a gift card, we had the time and reservations were made.\n\nWe arrived at the Fashion Show Mall and parked half way from the north forty.  We made our way around the outside of the mall and entered.  \n\nVery nice atmo and servers in white shirts.  We had a window table.  Sounds fancy....but it was not.  We gazed out on the promenade outside and watched people loiter and or pass by.\n\nService was initially slow, and pretty much stayed that way through the entire meal.  I had a drink run empty and was not addressed until 15-20 minutes after.\n\nI ordered up the Chicken Piccata.  It looked delicious on the menu.  The GF ordered up Chef KB's Lobster Carbonara.\n\nWe chowed down on bread prior to plate touchdown.  If they don't bring the balsamic, be sure to ask for it.\n\nWhen the plates arrived, I surveyed the contents.  It all looked good enough.  Dipping into the two plates with my fork.....something seemed off.  It seemed almost sort of commonplace.  \n\nMy eyes and my knowledge of the location told me I was at someplace that was supposed to be special.   My tastebuds were telling me I have been here many times before.  I could not really put my finger on it.  That was until I noticed the gift card the GF was partially paying with.  On the back of the card, were familiar corporate foodie locations I was well aware of.  \n\nPutting it all together, Maggiano's taste reminded my of other chains.  Putting it all together, I can check this off the list.","useful":9,"funny":5,"cool":4}

I had been starving myself since the morning in anticipation of this meal. We took the first available, which was outside and I wouldn't recommend it. It's not Maggiano's fault, but there was an iPod commercial running on a continuous loop on one of the outdoor televisions at the mall. Even with the ambient noise, and the restaurant's own music, by the time we were done with dinner, I was ready to jab a fork in both of my ears. That being said, I still had a great dinner! \n\nI've never been disappointed with the food nor service, and this time was no different. Our waiter was very nice and attentive and helped us pick out a really good bottle of wine.  We started with the fried mozzarella with marinara sauce... yummm.  The Maggiano salad has a great light flavored dressing and little bits of prosciutto in it.... so tasty! And for the main course we shared my favorite dish on the face of this planet, the chicken and spinach manicotti. Words just cannot do this dish justice, suffice it to say it's freakin fabulous. \n\nI somehow mustered the courage to order desert, even though my stomach was filled to the max. But I just absolutely love their cheesecake.

Giant crystal chandeliers line the majestic hallways as you pass through the entryway and multiple private dining areas lined with dark wood.  The bar area is dark paneled, well-staffed, and tucked far in the busy back \/ main dining room.  It was packed when we arrived, but we found seats and ordered cocktails quite easily (though we heard there was a one-hour wait for tables for those without reservations).\n\nWhen our table for 10 was ready we headed over to a corner lot where our group gathered.  It wasn't particularly easy to navigate the space in which they'd placed our party, as they've crammed as many tables in the room as they can and we were situated up against six booths. However, the waiters were quite patient practicing a constant ballet \/ battle with us while we hugged one another and took photographs (or they just went around the other way).\n\nThe ambiance inside Maggiano's was so dark, warm, and cozy that I was expecting more from the food.  The calamari that someone ordered as an appetizer was boring, bland, and uninspired.  The spinach salad I ordered was GIANT and tasty; however, I wished I'd stopped there.  Unfortunately my huge vat of gnocci was equally bland and mediocre, and the bread on the tables was stale\/hard.  It was so loud and busy in the restaurant (and I was drunk, which I'll get to in a minute) that I didn't even think to ask to try GT's entree (linguini and clams in red sauce) which he said was a good thing, because he hated it (and said that the food was much better a few years ago).\n\nThe adorable accordian player was a wonderful touch; he played some of our requests at one end of the table (although it was so loud in the restaurant that those on the other end couldn't hear).  Throughout our meal I was shocked that I wasn't drinking my wine; every time I turned to look at my glass I could swear it looked as if I hadn't touched it.\n\nTurns out that the stealth waiters were just constantly topping it off, which unfortunately resulted in a disequilibrium in the brain of yours truly, and my evening ended with me trying to get my mother in law to take us to a strip club and arguing with GT's uncle (who'd flown in from Oahu for the occasion) about whether or not boys are hornier than girls.  BAD, SELF, BAD!  Perhaps a waiter asking a gal every now and again if she'd like more wine would help a hypothetically drunk girl manage her evening in a slightly more classy manner.\n\nMy main gripe, however, was that GT and I had made cupcakes for dessert that spelled out \"OH, SHIT, SHE'S 70!\" when all lined up properly.  But we brought them in our cupcake pan and the waiter brought them out in the same pan we'd brought them in (though we'd asked that they be put on a large plate).  As a result, they read \"OHSH   ITSH  ES70!\"  Also, although the kind\/patient waiter did light the candles for us, I got the impression that the staff just wrote us off at the end, or perhaps someone in the back was a little ticked off with us for bringing our own dessert.  Regardless of the reason, I thought it very odd that they didn't bring us plates or forks with dessert - we had to hunch over the table and eat cupcakes over the tiny cupcake wrappers, carefully trying not to spill crumbs everywhere, which is not so easy to do when you're drunk on Maggiono's bottomless glass of wine.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":2}

I wanted a lighter fare so I ordered the caprese mozzarella and the cheese was so good.  I did order grilled scallops for my main course, but I think it was sitting under the lights for too long and the scallops were overcooked...to the point of being stringy and hard.  The manager took the order away and offered to replace the scallops for another dish on the house.  At that point we were full from the pasta dish so we declined.  I think it was just an oversight on such a busy night.  Beside this incident, we really enjoyed our meal at Maggiano, service was excellent, food was delicious, ambiance was authentic and on point.

I went with my Mom and her sister and my bf (Chris L.) last week while in Vegas.  I shared the gnocchi and meat lasagna with Chris L. and my Mom and aunt shared the corn pasta with shrimp.  The corn pasta was a must for them because they are both on a gluten-free diet so regular wheat pasta just doesn't cut it.  I love that a serious Italian restaurant cares about the wheat-free side of life and offers wheat-free options.  I also love that a serious Italian restaurant can taste this good and not break the bank.\n\nThe wine list is great and the desserts were pretty good--I got the profiterole with ice cream and chocolate sauce and the dessert would've been divine if it weren't for the profiterole....  The two baby boomers at the table each got the (GF) creme brulee and loved it.\n\nSo, for what Maggiano's is, I'm giving it 5 stars.

The second biggest issue was the stretched too thin service; it wasn't inattentive, but frantic and rushed. \n\nThe drinks were decent; but their happy hour is incredible! I will definitely stop in again for the half price (selected) drinks and cheap bar bites. \n\nThe food was unfortunately pretty hit or miss. For appetizers, Taylor and I tried their assortment of bruschetta; this was undoubtedly the best dish of the evening. The shrimp one was my favorite and also the most unique in my opinion. I have to say, I think the Italian Beef bite didn't have the Fontina cheese it was supposed to but it didn't phase Taylor. We also had a Caesar salad- average at best. \n\nTaylor also really enjoyed his chicken meatball, mozzarella, sundried tomato, and pesto fettuccine. My entree wasn't as impressive. I ordered their \"famous rigatoni \"D\"\"; it was served in an undersized bowl, swimming in an ocean of bland, under reduced cream sauce with no Marsala flavor, the mushrooms were whole and undercooked, and the caramelized onions were cut to a small dice- not thin sliced like generally expected when an item features caramelized onion. The roasted chicken was the only redeeming part- tender and flavorful. I tried, but couldn't attempt to enjoy more than a couple bites. \n\nOur server was understanding and brought back a menu to pick something else. We had a show less than an hour away, so I didn't want to order another full entree worried it would take too long and we would be rushing to the show. I enjoyed the bruschetta so I figured go with a sure thing at this point and asked about the house salad's base- \"is it mixed greens?\"   \"Yes\".  \"ok, I'll have that\". It was not mixed greens. Same romaine from the Caesar (and I assume the same on the chopped salad where it makes more sense). Despite expecting a different salad, the house dressing was really great and the crispy pancetta was even better. \n\nOverall, I don't think I'll be joining them for a nice dinner and relaxed evening, but I'll give their happy hour a try and hope they can redeem themselves a bit.","useful":8,"funny":3,"cool":3}

We started with a party of 12 which became 13. I was able to update it on the phone with no issue. Being a large group, we had to order Family Style and choose our menu items prior to the meal. I had one person gluten-free (celiac), one low-carb, and two that could not eat mushrooms. To say choosing items was a challenge would be true, however, the crew at Maggiano's didn't even bat an eyelash at this! The chef that evening came out to verify our menu and speak with our friend that required gluten-free. The chef was able to make side plates of what was ordered just for him so it was safe. He even mentioned that the fried prosciutto that came on the Chopped Salad would not be safe for him because it's prepared near gluten products, so he would prepare a separate bowl anyway for him - something we didn't know about even though I had verified the dish did not come with any gluten-based items. The meal was delicious and very filling. I took back to my hotel room the remains of the braised beef contadina - beautiful slow cooked beef that fell apart in your mouth. I was worried folks would want more, but we had a few platters with food left on them. Wine selection was excellent and I had an after dinner espresso that reminded me of my first in Italy years ago. The tiramisu was delicious and I wished I had the platter of it all to myself.  The space is beautiful and even more so since they had decorated for Christmas. There were other large groups so it was a bit loud and made conversations a bit difficult. I would definitely return here with a smaller group to be able to enjoy the cozy ambiance better.

The first time we sat on the patio and I swear a cockroach bit my leg. SOOOOOO GROSS. I don't think that's the restaurant's fault... The interior appears very clean. Came here for dinner the other night to meet up with a friend at 7pm but hadn't called to make a reservation. My boy and I got there a little early so we put our name down (wait was 30 mins, nbd) and took a seat at the bar. The bartender took a minute to get to us but was friendly and made an AWESOME drink for me. Moscato Mojito. Definitely try it!!\n\nWithin 10 minutes, our buzzer went off for our table. I brought it over with my still nearly full drank-drank but had to wait like 10 more minutes at the stand to be seated. I get that it was much faster than the 30 minute prediction... But don't tell me my table is ready then make me wait again while with a drink in hand. Whatev. \n\nWe were seated, our server said he'd be right with us. Our server came back and took our drink order. We ordered 3 of those moscato mojitos (one extra for our late friend lol). I'm telling you! Try it!!! Our friend showed up shortly after and we got our drank-dranks. Server asked if we'd decided on our meals yet... Our friend just sat down.... Give us like 2 more minutes? Ok cool! He came back like 15 minutes later. With bread and oil. We ordered and asked for vinegar to go with the oil. He never brought it....\n\nMeanwhile the table next to us had sat down 5 minutes after us and was being served their food. Again, I get that we were taking our time and our friend was late, WHATEV. But their server was ON IT. I was able to get his attention and asked for vinegar. It took him 12 seconds. I was so jealous of the table next to us. \n\nFood finally came like 30 minutes later and I was a little disappointed with the size of the salad that my boy and I agreed to share because it was \"enough for two\"... Maybe enough for two kids. My ravioli and side of broccolini were really good tho. Our server came back 10 minutes later to ask if we needed anything. I was gonna get a dessert but after waiting forever for our meal and having never gotten vinegar from him, I decided to pass fearing it would take too long. Just the check thanks! Ugh. That was another 10 minute ordeal. I don't recall him thanking us or looking forward to our next visit but that may have been said...\n\nOverall, 3 stars only cuz our service was slow and spotty. Memorable I suppose but not for the right reasons. Food was good. Nothing to write home about but satisfying. Dranks were BOMB. I'll go back just for that Moscato Mojito!

One of the members had specific eating needs, and a reservation was made well ahead of time so that the party could be split into 3 tables of 8 each in order to not do the family style eating. Again, the restaurant had agreed to this specific arrangement a number of months ahead of time.\n\nOnce we arrived, the restaurant did not honor this original agreement. We were told that it would have to be family style eating. A number of us had no desire to eat that much food, and were unhappy about being charged a mandatory price for food we weren't going to eat anyway. ESPECIALLY as the restaurant had agreed to allow us to order individually.  \n\nThey kept reiterating that is was for our \"benefit\" as we would get food at different times unless it was family style. We kept repeating that this was not an issue for us--we just wanted to be able to order individually. So we sat there for an hour, as one person after another discussed it with the servers.  One of our group finally was \"allowed\" to speak with someone in authority, at which point they relented and allowed us to order individually. An hour. It took an hour before they would agree to follow through with the original promise.\n\nOverall, it was a lousy customer service experience. The restaurant tried to back down on their agreement, and then tried to out wait us. Just terrible.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It had some type of a white (creme?) sauce with it. The dinner also included appetizers and dessert. It's a tremendous amount of food and the only way to go if you dont want to hit up the buffet's.  \n\nThe one thing I will add is that the service is not exactly the best. It took several requests before anyone brought us water or drink refills (soda, tea, beer, etc). It was also a bit difficult to get additional bread n butter. It just seemed to take an inexorably long time.\n\nOverall it was worth it and our service could have been affect by the sheer size of our group.

Value: for the level of cuisine, it is definitely overpriced (3).\n\nIf I were to sum up what the feeling was after leaving Maggiano's, it would be an overpriced, upscale Olive Garden. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food is definitely better as is the service. But the prices seemed exorbitant for what it was. \n\nWe ordered a plate of fried zucchini, a lunch special (half chicken parmesan sandwich and half Caesar salad), and a plate of gnocchi.\n\nThe fried zucchini was a bit greasy and the coating was too heavy. The ranch dressing was relatively bland and lacked acidity. For $12 it was a smaller portion than I expected.\n\nThe lunch special with a half portion of a soup, salad or sandwich for $10.50. I got the chicken parm sammy with a half Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was pretty generic and generally uninteresting (there was no garlicky, lemony, anchovy punch at all). The chicken parmesan sandwich was very skimpy on the chicken parm and could have used more marinara.\n\nThe gnocchi fared better. The gnocchi was soft and not overly gummy. However the sauce it was paired with was overly salty and needed more acidity to lighten the dish.\n\nService was good and prompt. Our water glasses remained filled and our food\/check came quickly. \n\nFor families, they do have a changing station in the family bathroom which is hovering over the toilet. There is no private area to breastfeed. Strollers are parked around the hostess station while an infant car seat can fit in one of the booths.\n\nOverall, the joint is okay in my books.

Our server was very gracious, and the bread was amazing!\n\nI ordered Chicken Florentine with Angel hair which absolutely blew my mind. The chicken was stuffed with spinach, parmesan cheese, and sun dried tomatoes and coated with bread crumbs.

We had a large group (17). We arrived but since we all drove seperately we clearly starting arriving at different times. Two of us arrived checked in and was told by the hostess we had to have more than half to be seated, fair enough. 5 minutes later I go back to the hostess and tell her 13 of us are there. She says ok it will just be a few minutes. 5 min later we check again and they say our table is being set up and water is being placed (which I don't see why water being placed would hinder us from sitting down but ok?!?!) so it will only be a min. 10 minutes later we go back again tell them our whole party is here and we are then told by a pretty snotty hostess that it will be a few minutes since we went from 17 to 14 people..I was so confused because we not once said we were down to 14 AND the reservation was made for 17 people, which is exactly what we had. Annoyed another person in the party went up to the hostess and a minute later we were being sat. No clue what he said to get us seated. Greeting and first impression 0 stars.\n\nWe were greeted by our servers as we were sitting down and they took our drink orders. Our servers were great, friendly and attentive. 5 stars!\n\nThroughout the course of our meal we realized we were missing some plates. Mind you this meal was a preset meal ordered and planned online prior, of which we had confirmation. After asking our server about the missing dishes he said he was informed of something totally different. Irritated we just said never mind let's just get thru this dinner and leave. The manager came and spoke to our table and apologized for the error. She was sincere and after all was said and done everyone was content. The food was pretty good, comparable to other Italian restaurants. 3 stars.\n\nNot sure I would go back but its location is nice, overseeing the Wynn and las vegas blvd at the fashion show mall.

She was super friendly, cracking jokes with everyone keeping the atmosphere positive\/festive, on top of our every needs, and personnel touches stood out for me.

Great service.\n\nSince it was decent size party we had nine. Terri was able to order family style meal. It reminded me Bucca di Beppo style. Starters we had fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip, and caesar salad. Entrees not sure the filling believe ricotta raviolis with tomato sauce, spaghetti with tomato sauce, chicken marsala think, and lasagna. Dessert chocolate cake, and one more forgot. By the time got to the dessert was stuffed. None of the dishes had WoW factor at ALL. Some of them felt like lack any depth of flavor. The tomato sauce in the spaghetti and am sure same base sauce use on the lasagna. Bland not even sure if they put salt or pepper in it. The portion size got nothing to say except nice and generous. The pricing not all that bad for strip restaurant. The atmosphere is upscale but looking at the prices reasonable. It located in the Fashion Show Mall so parking is ample and whether you valet or not easy access. \n\nOverall so many more italian restaurant in Vegas that are just as reasonable that food taste so much better.

The food was alright, not super flavorful at all or worth the dime dropped. \n\nThe waiter was excellent, however the hostesses were unfortunately very unfriendly and rude. They didn't even lead us to our table they just pointed us where to go, in turn we got lost because this restaurant is quite large and bustling with waiters and waitresses between the many many tables on the floor. \n\nAfter we got seated finally our experience was much more pleasant thanks to the waiter. I got the steak and ravioli special ($26) and was not impressed. The steak were little medallions about an inch thick and 3 inches in diameter but no flavor-- not even salt or pepper. The 3 raviolis were good but the stuffing was a little too salty for me (I am a little salt sensitive). \n\nOne of my friends had the carbonara special which is supposed to come with a poached egg, instead it arrived at our table as almost completely raw. The yolk was bright yellow and you could still see the clear jelly-like sac. The waiter graciously offered to redo it and bring another fresh on the house and did agree that is in no way a poached egg saying he could even poach one better than that. \n\nMy other friend got the piccata and said that california pizza kitchen piccata was better. \n\nIt smells delicious in here which is what attracted us to this place, but maybe we ordered the wrong things. I probably won't give this place another shot though, as there are too many good established restaurants I am aware of already.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I'll start with, we booked Maggiano's for our out of state wedding reception. From the very first email inquiry, to picking up our items the day after our wedding, working with the staff at Maggiano's LV was a true and honest blessing. Our wedding day was perfect for so many reasons... one of the top being, we chose this restaurant venue. \n\nYou would think planning an out of state reception by email correspondence would be hard? Nope. Not with Maggiano's LV. Beth and Jessie made our reception dreams come to life! They made the entire process easy and were always helpful- they were always focused on what we were envisioning. Out of every wedding vendor, they were always the quickest to respond. \n\nWe were able to off our decorations the night before but we also had the option of shipping our items to the venue at anytime. We had all three banquet rooms reserved. \n\nWhen I walked into the reception, it was so hard to keep it together. It was even more beautiful than I could have imagined. They really went above and beyond with every detail. Not that you even need a lot of detail- the venue itself is gorgeous. You can't beat the view. \n\nThe food- everyone still talks about the food. Seriously- we will not go back to Vegas without eating at Maggiano's. Just a few highlights of what was served (you can't go wrong with anything)- chicken saltimbocca, pesto alfredo cheese raviolis, meatballs and asiago crusted shrimp. Okay...now my mouth is watering. \n\nWe set up our own iPhone for music- their audio system worked perfectly. There is plenty of dance floor space. \n\nThe service was incredible. Like I said, Beth and Jessie were absolutely incredible to work with- Myself, my husband and my in-laws (everyone who worked with them closely) were all treated like family. There was another staff member who passed around our small plate food items and he constantly made sure myself and the wedding party ate. I honestly would have gotten a chance to try our food if it wasn't for him. I wish I would have gotten his name because so many guests enjoyed his friendly presence as well. \n\nI can't tell you enough how reassuring it was to know, all of our items would be kept safe until the next morning when we could pick them up. Not having to worry about that or having to ask a family member to stay back and do that was such a blessing. \n\nI could go on and on about how smooth our wedding reception went, thanks to Maggiano's LV, but then it would turn into a book.

Somehow, I was put in charge of finding a restaurant suitable for all four of us. Normally, I shy away from huge responsibility at work. I avoid the break room so I don't have to ever have to take out the trash. That's just how lazy I am.\n\nAnyway, with this language challenged arrangement, I knew it was going to be up to me (and my two years of Spanish in college) to keep the dinner engaging, organized, and running smoothly. Luckily for me, Maggiano's helped out with the experience.\n\nThe two Chilean clients communicated to me that they loved steak and Italian food. With the help of my Yelp Blackberry application, I suggested Benihana or Maggiano's (and tried not show sadness in my eyes). Ironically, their eyes lit up when they heard Maggiano's and the date was set.\n\nFor starters, the staff here is a superb. The hostess helped me make a reservation for a couple hours later, so I was able to give the rest of the dinner participants time to get ready, as I ran off and went shopping for a little gift for La Novia at the nearby mall. Our server was awesome. How lucky was I that the server was Chilean? He helped out immensely making our Chilean clients feel comfortable, recommending dishes and beers, and making on occasional joke or two. Great guy. Great server. Give that guy a raise.\n\nAs for the food, it wasn't terrible. We had the \"all you can eat family style\" meal, which included two salads, two appetizers, four main courses, and two desserts to share (and share and share) until we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant.\n\nAppetizers: We had the \"Calamari Fritte\" and \"Stuffed Mushrooms.\" The fried calamari was average and the dipping sauce was essentially Ragu. I liked the stuffed mushrooms and so did the rest of the group as had another round of it. However, I did wonder why they were not given an Italian name on the menu. Maybe the guy who wrote the menu only took 2 years of Italian in college?\n\nSalads: The \"Chopped Salad\" was a eally good salad. There is no way it can be good for you.  We also had the \"Italian Tossed Salad\" and it was wonderful. Who doesn't love a good tossed salad by an Italian?\n\nMain courses: We ordered 4 different main courses. The \"Spaghetti, Meatball\" and I could have made it better at home. The \"Veal Ravioli\" was pretty good. It wasn't as heavy as I had imagined. The \"Gnocchi, Tomato Vodka Sauce\" was my contribution to the group. The gnocchi just melted in your mouth. It was the best dish all night and we had another round of it. The \"The \"Salmon, Lemon & Herb\" smelled pretty bad. I was afraid to get that on my lips or fingers. I didn't want La Novia to pick me up from the airport and think I was having an affair or something.\n\nDesserts: The Crème Brulee was pretty good. We had three rounds of this. I love burnt cream. We had the \"N.Y. Style Cheesecake\" and it well, it was just plain ol' cheesecake. I think the \"N.Y.\" stood for \"Not Your.\" As in, \"Not Your Style Cheesecake.\"\n\nOverall, the food was up and down and mostly mediocre. It was factory style Italian food that lacked much distinctive flavor. Essentially, it was a pricier version of \"Olive Garbage\" or \"Bucket of Crappo.\"\n\nThis was no more than 2 to 2.5 star food. But the ambiance and staff helped make this a very successful business dinner. So successful, we went out on the town for an adventure that included gambling, karaoke, and general Las Vegas debauchery.\n\nAnd well, I will award another star for that.","useful":13,"funny":14,"cool":12}

When we walked in, I expected to be met with resistance due to our reservations not working in their system, but they quickly worked us into a table as we had a show to make, and the waiter, Rafael, made sure he would have us served without leaving us in an anxious rush. He was quite courteous and refilled our bread and water while checking on us ever so often. \n\nI ordered a Manhattan clam chowder as an appetizer, a seafood linguine as an entree, and a sampler tiramisu for the dessert. If you are hungry, then this is the place for you because they are strong with their portions. The pricing is very fair for a decently fancy place. My entree was piled to the top with lobster, clams, and muscles; I actually wasn't able to finish all of it. This was the first time I've had Manhattan clam chowder which is a red tomato soup base instead of a white, and I enjoyed it very much. Everything was cooked to perfection on my plate, and the tiramisu dessert was also delicious. \n\nI would recommend this place highly for their customer service and food. They seem very flexible. If you're looking for an Italian place to eat at in Vegas tonight. I would highly recommend this place!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

For easy parking we went to park at the Neiman Marcus side and take the elevator up. You would have to walk outside at the strip but the weather in October is perfect for a walk. If you want a shorter walk, there is a parking at the back thru the road between Trump Tower and Fashion Show Mall. \n\nMaggiano is located on the 3rd floor of the mall. You have option of dining inside or outside. There is a separate bar section if you just want to have some drinks. You can opt to eat at the bar as well. \n\nTheir lunch service was pretty quick. Our food came in within 15 mins. Our server was terrific, polite, knowledgable about the menu and the special of the day (she mentioned the $5 mimosa). \n\nFor appetizer, we had crispy calamari (I love calamari and this place has a great one). Next was a big plate of toothsome chopped salad with bacon and avocado! Anything with bacon is indeed delicious! And this one was no exception. Yumm. For the main entree I had shrimp scampi with angel hair pasta. Generous portion of shrimps! The pasta was perfectly cooked, but the sauce was a little bland than the usual. \n\nBetween the bread, appetizer, salad and entree, I was so full. So no desert today. \n\nGreat spot for lunch! And will come back to try their Brunch on the weekend!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":4}

Decided to take the family as part of our Vegas Birthday weekend getaway. It was my sons 21st and wanted to make it special. Probably a little much for my kids (Young Adults). They are of the Vegas Buffet Breed. But they agreed to check it out.  Had a reservation and asked for the Best table in the house overlooking the Vegas Strip. Dinner was in typical Maggiano style. Hot, Full of Flavor, Huge in serving size just perfect. I would say the only down side was service. Granted the place was full and the it was a Vegas Friday night. Had to ask for water, drinks, rolls, the basics.  The server was not on his game at all. Shame normaly the staff goes above and beyond. Still we had a great dinner and I will be going back to my own local Maggiano's (Woodland Hills) hopefully soon.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We had a large group of 16 people for our wedding dinner.  I had made reservations 2 weeks in advance. They called the day prior to the reservation to confirm and then they called the morning of the reservation date to get my order for the family style dinner. I selected from the Chefs selection menu. Lobster baked tilapia, chicken parmesan, mushroom il fornaio and beef tenderloin medallions. For appetizers we selected the calamari, caprese and bruschetta.  For dessert we selected creme brûlée and tiramisu. Absolutely everyone enjoyed everything they ate! The meat entrees were all tender and juicy. Nothing was over cooked or under cooked. The food was served timely- longest wait was 5 mins between appetizers and entrees.  The portions and amount of food can be described as ABUNDANT. The customer service was perfect. They allowed us to bring our wedding cake earlier in day and served it at the end of the wedding feast! I highly recommend them for special events!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Yeah, I know.  Why the hell would anyone want to go to Vegas with minors?  Ask my wife.  Anyway, we needed to find a place with food that was better than McDonald's for the adults and would appeal to our kids and not bankrupt us.\n\nI had the nifty Yelp app on my new, handy dandy Crackberry and it pointed us to Maggiano's.  The app provided many positive Yelp reviews ( of dubious value as usual), a web address and phone number enabling me to call and make a reservation and a map feature that helped us find the place with ease.\n\nWe were seated promptly upon arrival and the waiter was very kind to my wife and I in spite of the antics of my three little darlings.  It can be a royal pain to take care of families at a nice restaurant with tablecloths and wine glasses but the service was very good.\n\nThe have a full kids menu from which our children were able to choose something they liked.  My wife had some chicken pesto pasta dish which was tasty and I ordered chicken francesca, which was supposedly inspired by the Italian cuisine from St, Louis.  Having become intimately familiar with St. Louis Italian cuisine over the years I think that was a reach but nonetheless my dinner was very good-especially for a chain.  The price was very reasonable and I would love to dine here again but I'm not planning to go to Vegas again in the near future and unfortunately the closest franchise is in Orange County.  Perhaps they'll open a San Diego location some day.","useful":3,"funny":3,"cool":3}
